<p>The time in system cycles between the two memory locations is measured and shown.</p>

<p>Default are suitable memory locations for a measurement of user programs, timed between each Wait_Recal - call.</p>
<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>The cycle count is always measured between two memory locations. The locations to enter as start and end address are usually "inverse" to the natural order of memory locations.</p>

<p>For example, to do a measurement between two calls of WaitRecal, you chose as start address the "exit" of WaitRecal and as an end address the entry point of WaitRecal.</p>

<p>That way you measure all cycles IN BETWEEN two calls of WaitRecal.</p>

<p>Many original games and some homebrew stuff use the BIOS WaitRecal routine in their game loop to stabilize display, so the default setting should work fairly often.</p>

<p>Nonetheless you will find, especially if you program yourself optimzed stuff, that you will want to measure you own routines. For that you can:
<ol><li>
<p>enter start and end addresses</p>
</li><li>
<p>you can also name these and persist them, so you can easily reuse them in a later session.</p>
</li></ol>
</p>

<p>Just type in a name for your measurement in the textbox and press the save button. The new measurement setting will be added to the combobox to chose from.</p>

<p>You can also delete entries using the "delete" button.</p>
