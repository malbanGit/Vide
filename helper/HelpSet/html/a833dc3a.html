<em>profi window</em></p><br/>

<p><b>Note!</b><br />
In order to use the profiler you have to enable it <i>before</i> the emulation starts (vecxi window opens). You can configure profiling in <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>configuration&rarr;Disassembler: enable profiler</tt><br />
</p>

<p>The profiling as of now is limited to two things:
<ul><li>
<p>count accesses to an instruction</p>
</li><li>
<p>count cycles executed</p>
</li></ul>
</p>
<h3>Profi-Window</h3>

<p><b>Access</b><br />
are counted and displayed in the profi window.</p>

<p><b>Cycles</b><br />
Are counted for each subroutine and displayed as "sum till return" and displayed. Cycles are also displayed as percent of total execution time.</p>

<p>Note:<br />
Since tracking of a subroutine is done via watching the stack (changes) - it might be possible to get "false" results in the profiler if you do heavy stack manipulations within your program.</p>

<p><b>Modes</b><br />
The profiler can run in two modes:
<ul><li>
<p>non tracker mode<br />
Here the complete runtime of the current vectrex program is counted and displayed</p>
</li><li>
<p>tracker mode<br />
This mode is only available if a tracki window is actively open. In this mode the program locations that lie in between the given tracking addresses are watched (usually one vectrex round) and displayed.<br />
The display in profi always shows the last complete "track" round.</p>
</li></ul>
</p>
<h3>Dissi-Window</h3>

<p>If profiling is enabled (and the columns in the dissi table are also enabled: "PR access" and "PR cycles") you can also watch the cycles/accesses in dissi - for <i>each</i> instruction!</p>
