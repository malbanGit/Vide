<h1>Game loop</h1>

<p>When creating a new project (or create a new file of type "vectrex") one is given the choice to create a standard vectrex game loop.</p>

<p>The project window looks like:</p>
<br/><p align="center">

<em>new project window</em></p><br/>

<p>If you select (like in the window shown) the checkbox "create standard game loop", that said game loop file will be created (in the example, a file called "MainLoopTest.asm").</p>

<p>Also the standard vectrex include file: "VECTREX.I" will be copied to the new project directory. The whole scenario than looks like:</p>

<h3>Game Loop</h3>

<p>The game loop is a section of the vectrex program that is (more or less) repeated throughout the complete lifecycle of the game.</p>

<p>It often starts with a recalibration routine (ensuring a stable, flicker free display). Other parts of the game loop handle:
<ul><li>
<p>player input</p>
</li><li>
<p>sound generation and output</p>
</li><li>
<p>caclulations (e.g. colision detection)</p>
</li><li>
<p>display</p>
</li></ul>
</p>

<p>The order of these can change - but most of the time at least the above are present. In a clean (not to optimized) program the game loop can most of the time be easily recognized by the recalibration, a couple of instructions mainly consisting of calling subroutines and jumping back to the start of the loop.</p>

<p>In more sophisticated programs main loops might not so easily be recognized.</p>

<p>The game loop created by vide is fairly simple and easily recognizable. The loop is contained in the section between:<br />
<tt>main: <br />
...<br />
...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BRA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; main</tt><br />
</p>

<p>Further enhancements of the main loop should be inserted there (for starters preferable in calling subroutines which handle the tasks you think of).</p>

<p>The created game loop by vide can be run out of the box, but it does not represent more than a little "hello world" program:</p>
