<h1>Preconditions</h1>

<p><b>Note</b>:<br />
I am not sure whether the executable flags of the binaries (linux/mac) will be kept intact. I use a Windows "ZIP" program and am being a bit dubious about it. Please check the respective directories (see below) that the binaries are executable! <br />
 <br />
</p>

<hr />

<p>Vide comes with "all" binaries needed to use "C". The "all" is in quotes because it <i>might</i> not true for all platforms. Installed and tested are below systems.</p>

<p>To execute gcc several libraries are needed. I only supply the libraries for windows - since they can easily be distributed (and found by gcc). If they are in the same directory as the executable - gcc finds them.</p>

<p>Following libraries are needed:
<ul><li>
<p>libGMP</p>
</li><li>
<p>libMPFR</p>
</li><li>
<p>libICONV</p>
</li></ul>
</p>
<h2>Windows (32)</h2>

<p>The binaries for the windows executables are located at: "Vide/C/Win32/bin/"</p>

<p>The binaries were compiled using MingW. All needed libraries are in the above directory. No Win64 binaries are provided - the 32 binaries also work under Win64 systems.</p>

<p>The above executables were built (not gcc) and tested using: WinXP (32bit), Win7 (64bit), Win8 (64bit), Win10 (64bit) (virtual machines)</p>
<h2>Mac OS X</h2>

<p>The binaries for the Mac executables are located at: "Vide/C/Mac/bin/"</p>

<p>For some more information see also the readme file in the directory "Vide/C/Mac/lib"</p>

<p>For the Mac version I was (finally also) able to compile gcc using static linked versions of the above mentioned libraries. These should work just fine.</p>

<p>The Mac version was built and tested on an iMac mid 2011 running Mac OS X Sierra.</p>
<h2>Linux 64</h2>

<p>The binaries for the Linux64 executables are located at: "Vide/C/Linux64/bin/"</p>

<p>For the linux 64 version I was able to compile gcc using static linked versions of the above mentioned libraries. These should work out just fine. It is a little bit hard to test if the compiler works "standalone", since every linux system I used had said libraries installed out of the box (Debian/Ubuntu).</p>

<p>The linux 64 was built and tested running Linux Ubuntu installed from "ubuntu-16.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso" (on a virtual machine).</p>
<h2>Linux 32</h2>

<p>The binaries for the Linux32 executables are located at: "Vide/C/Linux32/bin/"</p>

<p>For the linux 32 version I was able to compile gcc using static linked versions of the above mentioned libraries. These should work out just fine. It is a little bit hard to test if the compiler works "standalone", since every linux system I used had said libraries installed out of the box (Debian/Ubuntu).</p>

<p>The linux 32 was built and tested running Linux Ubuntu installed from "ubuntu-16.04.3-desktop-i386.iso" (on a virtual machine).</p>
