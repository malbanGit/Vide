<h1>eEprom DS2430A</h1>

<p>When creating a new project one can also create projects that support eEprom reading and writing.</p>

<p>For this example disable the "create standard game loop" creation (otherwise you get two main files, and the default won't be the eEprom example file).</p>

<p>Chose the settings like: (and press "create")</p>

<em>new project window</em></p><br/>

<p>In order for the example to be runable select the created file: "ds2430ExampleMain.asm", right click to show the popup-Menu and select "set as Main".</p>

<p>With this you tell the current project that the selected file should be treated as the main file, meaning - this file must be assembled.</p>

<em>changing main file</em></p><br/>

<p>As you see a couple of files (include files for low level access) are created along with the main file.</p>

<em>file structure</em></p><br/>

<p>There only two methods and one variable worth mentioning of the included files:
<ul><li>
<p>you must declare a RAM space of 32 consecutive bytes, in the example the name for that space is <tt>"eeprom_buffer"</tt> (that buffer should beforehand be filled with a "standard" setting, in case the eEprom is first used and thus empty)</p>
</li><li>
<p>upon starting the cartridge, you read the eEprom <tt>"JSR eeprom_load"</tt> (transfer 32 bytes to the above mentioned buffer - or upon first access reset the eEprom with the default values)</p>
</li><li>
<p>upon changing data in the buffer, that you wish to persist call <tt>"JSR eeprom_save"</tt>.</p>
</li></ul>
</p>

<p>That is all.</p>

<p>The example program just increases a counter each time it is started.<br />
(technically in vide the savestate is saved in a file with the name of the "bin" concatinated with "ds2430.ser" -  java serialization)</p>
