<h1>VIDE</h1>

<p>Vide is a collection of different sources - and some new creations - in a single application.<br />
It is a <b>V</b>ectrex <b>I</b>ntegrated <b>D</b>evelopement <b>E</b>nvironment.</p>

<p>I do not intend to make VIDE an "emulator of choice".</p>

<p>It will not be as pretty as ParaJVE, it will not be as fast as VecX and it won't be as "elegant" as the MAME/MESS emulation.</p>

<p>I am a pragmatic guy not one for beauty or aesthetics.</p>
