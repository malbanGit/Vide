<p>A "library" of vectrex essential documentations.</p>

<p>This (at least for me) is very helpfull as I don't have to look for all those manuals in the shelfs.</p>

<p>The "Library" is generated from all files that can be found in the documentation folder. Following "rules" are used to generate:
<ul><li>
<p>the file extension must be one of: "pdf", "txt", "rtf", "doc", "html", all other files are ignored</p>
</li><li>
<p>files containing "_critics.txt" or "_instructions.txt" are ignored</p>
</li><li>
<p>directories containing "firstvectrex" are ignored</p>
</li></ul>
</p>

<p>All other files and directories (provided they are not empty with above mentioned rules) are displayed.</p>

<p>For each selected entry the system wide default "viewer" is started when activated.</p>

<p>You can add your <i>own</i> entries by simply copying your documents in the directory (and restarting vide).</p>
