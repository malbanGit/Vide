<h1>Thanks!</h1>

<p>Vide is a collection of different sources - and some new creations - in a single application. It is a <b>V</b>ectrex <b>I</b>ntegrated <b>D</b>evelopement <b>E</b>nvironment.</p>

<p>It as of now consists of:
<ul><li>
<p>a java port of the vecx emulator (by me - Malban)<br />
The port is a port of a port and reaches back to the original author: <i>Valavan Manohararajah</i> of whom I can't find a valid homepage. Copyright status to me unkown, but as often as that code was used, I guess it is "freely distributable".<br />
 <br />
The port also has some enhancements, as you will notice.<br />
 <br />
This part will be called <b>vecxi</b> further on.<br />
 <br />
</p>
</li><li>
<p>a java port (by me - Malban) (or should I say a complete rewrite? - not much of the original code is left) of DASM6809, which I am sure also is a port of a port of a rewrite. Originally developed by <i>Sean Riddle</i>, Copyright (c)1995 Sean Riddle (freely distributable... see source files).<br />
 <br />
  The port also has some enhancements/changes, as you will notice.<br />
 <br />
This part will be called <b>dissi</b> further on.<br />
 <br />
 </p>
</li><li>
<p>a code adaption of a java 6809 assembler called "asmj".<br />
 (sourceforge: <a target="_blank" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/asmj/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/asmj/</a>) developed by <i>Bill Yakowenko</i>. <br />
The sources in the sourceforge zip, the svn version and the binaries are not complete nor compatible. I tried reaching out to the author, but have received no feedback yet. I fixed the part I am interested in - so that it works for me. The source is public domain. <br />
 <br />
This part will be called <b>assi</b> further on.<br />
 <br />
 </p>
</li><li>
<p>a set of editor classes, done by me. Syntax highlighting uses a modified version of "Syntax", a package done by (c) <i>Stephen Ostermiller</i> (<a target="_blank" href="http://ostermiller.org/syntax/">http://ostermiller.org/syntax/</a> ), the source is distributed under GNU V2 or later license (... see source files). M6809 Syntax JFlexed by me - Malban.  <br />
 <br />
This part will be called <b>vedi</b> further on.<br />
 <br />
 </p>
</li><li>
<p>a set of vector editor classes, done by me. Hm... didn't really reuse any other software here... something is wrong. <br />
 <br />
This part will be called <b>vecci</b> further on.<br />
 <br />
 </p>
</li><li>
<p>perhaps more will follow, like: <br />
some sound editing, <br />
or ym-stuff, <br />
or bitmap to vectrex conversion... <br />
 <br />
who knows where all paths lead...<br />
 <br />
You can start thinking about som <b>funni</b> names :-)</p>
