<title>Emulation: SID</title>

<h1>Emulation: SID</h1>

<p>I received a request to emulate the SID chip within Vide. While at first it sounds "strange" to emulate the Commodore C64 soundchip - the idea behind it is a special cartridge design with a SID chip on it.<br />
</p>

<p>The prototype of the card already exists and seems to work quite well. The chips registers are located at "forbidden" vectrex locations (addresses $8000 - $8020). Actually the emulation of that could be implemented in a couple of hours - since there are quite a few open source java C64 emulators available. The used SID emulation is a java version of "reSid" and works (for a few hours of work) remarkably well.</p>

<p>Also the SID registers are viewable using the dissi&rarr;carti window.  </p>
