<h1>New here?</h1>

<p>As noted on several other pages - Vide is a collection of "tools". Also - it was <b>INTENDED</b> to be a collection of tools.</p>

<p>As such the handling of Vide might at first be strange and not intuitive.</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Vide is not <i>solely</i> intended to be an emulator for the vextrex.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Vide is not intended to be used <i>solely</i> as an editor for vectors or an editor for assembler programming.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Vide is not intended solely to be used for debugging.</p>
</li><li>
<p>... (and so on)</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Vide is all of the above - and more. </p>

<p>Therefor there is not an easy entry point to vide, since it (by now) can do so much - and depending on what you want vide to be for yourself - the entry point you chose might be entirely different than the one I might chose for you.</p>

<p>Here are all the "Tools" Vide provides.</p>

<em>Tools</em></p><br/>

<p><b>Play a game</b><br />
If you want to play a "known" game/binary - your best start is to use the tool: <b>Starter</b>. <br />
It provides a list of all known and accessable games - double click on an entry - opens the emulator with the game.</p>

<p><b>Play a binary</b><br />
You can also open <b>Vecxi</b> (the emulator) and load a binary from your file system directly. The advantage of using starter however is - that additional information about the game is easily accessed (instructions/homepage/author), also if a game uses additional hardware it might be necessary to let vecxi know befor it starts - this can only be done if a game is defined as a "cartridge" and started via the starter.</p>

<p><b>Writing your own vectrex game</b><br />
The tool <b>Vedi</b> is your friend. You can start Vedi (vectrex editor) and build your own vectrex "project'. A project provides you with a ready to go game loop - just fill it with your game.<br />
Also from within Vedi you can access additional tools to enhance your game with (also with generated sources ...) graphics of different kinds, sounds and music. <br />
 <br />

<hr />

<p>These are three "main" entry points. The other tools are mostly supportive in nature. </p>

<p>All tools are described in depth within this help. Keep reading :-)!  </p>
