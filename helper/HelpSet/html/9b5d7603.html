<h1>Emulation: VecVox</h1>

<p>VecVox is a hardware extension for the vectrex which can be plugged into port two joystick port.</p>

<p>It was designed and build by Richard Hutchinson and gives programmers access to a SpeakJet speech chip. The hardware can still be ordered and is now known as AtariVox+, but using dipswitches
<ul><li>
<p>it can be used as a VecVox</p>
</li><li>
<p>or configured to emulate VecVoice</p>
</li></ul>
</p>

<p>It can be ordered at <a target="_blank" href="https://atariage.com/store/index.php">https://atariage.com/store/index.php</a><br />
<br />
<b>Note:</b><br />
You additionaly need a joystick cable extension, since the cartridge because of its design does not fit directly into a vectrex!</p>

<p>The speech is emulated by using samples.</p>

<p>The Datasheet of the chip can be found in the subdirectory: <br />
