<h1>Instrument editor</h1>

<p>(The upper half of this text is the same as in Mod-Conversion/Instrument editor!)</p>

<em>Music editor</em></p><br/>

<p>Here you can edit and experiment with the vectrex ADSR and TWANG tables. You can use the resulting data with mod file generation directly - or you can copy/paste the data to your own vecterx BIOS pieces and use them there - the format is identical.</p>

<p>There are 32 ADSR values which (provided the vectrex runs at 30000 cycles per update round) each represent a 0.02 seconds "piece" of a generated tone.</p>

<p>The values are "volumes" in the range from 0 (silence) to 15 (maximum volume). If within the "full" duration of the note (32*0.02) = 0.64 another sound is played, the ADSR will be chopped off - and the next note will start with its own ADSR range.</p>

<p>The Twang table are register frequency values (see Programmin the vectrex - sound), which are added to the PSG registers for the current channel (values range from -128 to + 127). This also "updates" each 0.02 seconds.</p>

<p>Regarding TWANG, some info:</p>

<ul><li>
<p>the TWANG values are roll over, they start at their respective zero-value after the max value is used</p>
</li><li>
<p>the BIOS routine uses different roll over values (6, 7, 8 for channel 0,1,2), the modified MOD-player routine uses always 8 (since it uses different TWANG values for each channel)</p>
</li><li>
<p>the internal twang counter is always increased, whether a note is played or not</p>
</li><li>
<p>the internal twang counter always (continues), it is not "reset" by playing a new note</p>
</li></ul>
<h3>Saving loading</h3>

<p>You can save the setting by giving a name and pressing the save button. <br />
You can retrieve old setting via the checkbox.</p>
<h3>Playing</h3>

<p>You can use the keyboard to listen to the sound generated by the current setting. For that place the cursor in the textfield behind "play" and press keyes.</p>
<h3>Noise</h3>

<p>With the checkbox you enable noise generation.</p>
<h2>Music</h2>

<p>In the large text area you can enter music notes as the BIOS expects. You can use + / * - to calculate values you can enter data with or without DB statements. Hitting the "play" button generates a vectrex program and runs that program in the emulator - so you can listen directly to your original music. </p>

<p>If you want you can also view the generated sourcecode in Vide.</p>

<p><b>Notice</b>:<br />
You have to also select the instrument that should play the music - otherwise you will not hear it playing.</p>
