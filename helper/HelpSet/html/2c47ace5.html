<h1>In general!</h1>

<p>The application "state" VIDE is in, is more or less persistent (if development keeps up).</p>

<p>VIDE remembers its open windows their size and their positions.</p>

<p>There are a few "main" windows and quite a few "child windows". Once any window is open - the gui makes no difference between main and child.</p>

<p>"My" difference between main- and child- windows is the place where they can be opened. Main Windows can be opened from the Menubar, there from the menu: "Tools":</p>
<br/><p align="center">

<em>menubar</em></p><br/>

<p>All other (child) windows are opened from the "main" windows.</p>
<h3>Navigation</h3>

<ul><li>
<p>Each window is accessable (uniconify/bring to front), via the window menu</p>
</li><li>
<p>Using CTRL/TAB gives access to a "quick" Window switcher</p>
</li><li>
<p>Windows can be iconified to the desktop</p>
</li><li>
<p>Thru tinylaf, themes are supported</p>
</li></ul>

<p><b>Note:<br />
</b> Pressing shift while using the Tools menu to open one of the main windows, opens a second main window of the selected type. (usually if one already exists that window will be brought to front/deiconified)</p>
