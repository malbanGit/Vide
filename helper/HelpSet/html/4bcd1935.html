<p><b>invoke Emulator after successfull assembly</b><br />
Well this is realy self explaining - isn't it?</p>

<p><b>scan for defined</b><br />
If checked, vedi scans files for the entities, this allows displaying / coloring of defined and undefined variables/macros and allows the "right/doubleclick" on such an entity to jump to its definition.</p>

<p><b>scan for vectorlists</b><br />
If checked, vecxi scans while running, whether BIOS vectrex routines draw a vectorlist, if so - vecxi saves the list in XML format, under the cartridge name.</p>

<p><b>load images in starter</b><br />
If checked the starter table also displays the images for the vectrex binaries that are available. While this looks nice - upon starting all images will be loaded into memory which:
<ol><li>
<p>takes quite a few seconds</p>
</li><li>
<p>uses much memory</p>
</li></ol>
</p>

<p>Default option is: off</p>

<p><b>MOTD active</b><br />
Message of the day - active or not...</p>

<p><b>automatically eject attached VecFever on compile success</b><br />
If you have a VecFever connected to the vectrex and your computer you have Vide eject the RAM disc of VecFever automatically after a build. The VecFever than starts the program called "cart.bin" that was saved to the RAM disk.</p>

<p>This feature as of now only works with Windows and Mac OS. I have at the moment not a running linux system and thus could not positively code an "eject" for linux.</p>

<p><b>V4E</b><br />
Here you can enter the path to the attached vecfever device. If the path is entered correctly you can transfer any started vectrex program to the vecfever by simply doing a command line "tf" from dissi (if vecfever is in RAMD-disk mode).</p>

<p>Note: <br />
As of now Vedi uses its own V4E definition... this is an open issue</p>

<p><b>start up with</b><br />
A vectrex "bin" file, that should be loaded upon start of Vide.</p>

<p><b> Sound settings</b><br />
</p>

<p><b>PSG Sound</b><br />
Switch whether PSG emulation is producing any sound (might switch off if you prefer to listen to <i>sampled</i> sound or <i>VecVoice/VecVox</i>).</p>

<p><b>Volume setting</b><br />
With this you set the sound volume.
<ul><li>
<p>Master, the "overall" volume</p>
</li><li>
<p>PSG, value of th PSG soundchip (other sounds come from emulated samples/voice modules)</p>
</li></ul>
</p>

<p><b>PSG Emulation</b><br />
Chose between two different emulation implementations. If LibAYEmu is chosen, you can also chose between different PSG chip emulation variations.</p>

<p><b>Colors for vecci</b><br />
