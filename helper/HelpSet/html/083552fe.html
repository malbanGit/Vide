<title>Example: VecLink V1</title>

<body class="doc">
<h1>Example: VecLink V1</h1>

<p>With the information about the veclink cables I was given a couple of binaries.</p>

<p>One of the binaries ("vl_test.bin") is a test program for the veclink V1 cable. The program was most likely written by Alex Herbert.</p>

<p>I disassembled the program and commented it.</p>

<p>It is by now a very well documented example on how to use veclink V1.</p>

<p>It can be found in the directory:<br />
</p>

<p><tt> codelib/Snippets/Alex Herbert/VecLinkV1/vlink1.asm<br />
</tt><br />
The program can be assembled and run in vide.</p>

<p>If you want you can look at it and rip it apart, but keep in mind, that my documentation says that VecLink V2 is much more stable.</p>

<p>For more information look at the source to the example and possibly at the "Emulation: VecLink V1 + V2" section.</p>

<p>Let me remind you, that there is no way to "automatically" configure vide to run two vecx instances, you have to start two instances manually:</p>

<p>Manually meaning:
<ul><li>
<p>go to the main menu and start a vecx</p>
</li><li>
<p>select the veclink binary you would like to play</p>
</li><li>
<p>press start</p>
</li><li>
<p>select for port 0 the input device you would like to use</p>
</li><li>
<p>select for port 1 the veclink cable you would like to use, start with the "left" side (although it does not really matter which side is plugged in first)</p>
</li><li>
<p>repeat the above process for a second vecx instance, </p>
</li><li>
<p>for port 1 select the "other side" (right?) of the same veclink cable</p>
</li></ul>
