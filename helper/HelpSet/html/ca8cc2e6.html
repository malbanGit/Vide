<h1>AYFX-Conversion</h1>

<p>Perhaps in a far, far away future I will do a FX generator/editor or at least a register editor for the AY-soundchip. Until that time this feature might help you doing sound effects.</p>

<p>There is a (discontinued - but runable on emulators) windows program called:<br />
<b>AY Sound FX Editor</b><br />
</p>
<br />

<p>Which can be found at: <a target="_blank" href="https://shiru.untergrund.net/software.shtml">https://shiru.untergrund.net/software.shtml</a><br />
</p>

<p>With that editor you can save files in a "*.afx" format. These files contain AY register values in a slightly compressed format.  These register storages are meant to contain sound effects.</p>

<p>With the software come about 200 different sound effects which you can use "out of the box" - or edit them yourself. The program looks like:</p>
<br/><p align="center">

<em>AYFX</em></p><br/>

<p>The copyright status of the program is unkown, there is no hint whatsoever regarding copyright. The programer seems to be known as "Shiru". Thanks for your software!</p>

<p>Right clicking on such a file allows you to "convert" it to vectrex usage (including sample code). The vectrex "player"-code was done by a proboard member which goes by the name "Vectrexrc"... Thanks!</p>

<p>Nothing more - nothing less...</p>
