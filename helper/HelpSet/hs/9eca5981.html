<h1>Debugging C</h1>

<p><b>Note</b><br>
The debugging in "C" is not that well tested, should errors occur while debugging (compiler errors?), than switch debugging off and tell me what happened, so I can enhance Vide!)<br>
(In order to be able to show the "C" contents in the assembler listing, I internally change the "C" file and compile it with different settings - so there <i>might</i> be errors, that only occur while using debug settings!) (see also "Optimizing C" and search for "EnrichmentOff")</p>
<h2>Using Vedi &amp; dissi</h2>

<p>Vedi is able to generate additional "C" debug information. To enable this go to your current C-Project, open the project configuration and check the checkbox "C debugging".</p>

<p>If enabled, Vide will generate for each "C"-File additional information.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>:<br>
As of now this only works for "*.c" files, included files are <b>not</b> processed in any way, even if included from in a "c" file that is otherwise processed.</p>

<p>In dissi additional "C"-lines are places within the disassembled sources, like:</p>
<br><p align="center">

<em>dissi with c-lines</em></p><br>

<p>Using Vide you can also set breakpoints to C-lines (if above restrictions are observed):</p>
<br><p align="center">

<em>breakpoint from C-sources</em></p><br>

<p>That is all there is for now regarding debugging "C". The rest is the same a debugging assembler sources, mainly using dissi and its children.</p>
<h2>Watches</h2>

<p>It is not possible yet to define watches for C-variables using the editor (Vedi). However global variables can be viewed as always using dissi and vari.</p>

<p>Just remember, that "C"-Variables have a leading underscore "_".</p>

<p>Local variables are located on the stack - there is no "easy" way to watch them (yet). If you need to, you can determine their stack address and add a watch manually via dissi command line, like:<br>
<tt><br>
watch $CBC9 1</tt><br>
</p>
<h2>Stack frame</h2>

<p>Using the debugger... There is no special stack frame display available for local "C" variables.</p>

<p>This is mainly due to the fact, that local variables can have the same names on one stackframe - and to display the varnames as stack addresses could possibly have double meanings.</p>

<p>Example: <tt><br>
__INLINE void testFunc()<br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int xx = 1;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br>
}<br>
int main(void)<br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int xx = 2;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;testFunc();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>here</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br>
}<br>
</tt><br>
</p>

<p>At the position of <b>here</b> (well INSIDE the inline function that is) the variable "xx" would be two times on the stack, once from main(), and once from testFunc(). One would (example) accessed with <br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stb 6,s</tt><br>
the other possibly with <br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stb 7,s</tt><br>
or the like. Naming the offsets (6 and 7 in this case) like the variable would be crossly confusing.</p>

<p>GCC generates comments, when accessing local variable. When you look at the comment section of dissi, you will see the variable name.</p>
