<h1>Emulation: eEprom Microchip 11AA010</h1>

<p>Based on the manual that can be got at the Microchip site and my own disassembly of VectorPilot - the only known cartridge, which makes use of the chip.</p>

<p>Emulation is only done in so far, that VectorPilot playes all right, not emulated at the moment are the command: CRRD, ERAL and SETAL.</p>

<p>Known cartridges which use this hardware:
<ul><li>
<p>VectorPilot</p>
</li></ul>
</p>

<p>Statefiles for the eEprom are always saved in the same directory and named as the original cartridge (bin) file, with the additional extension of: ".microchip.ser". <br>
(the save-format is java serialization)</p>
<h3>Technical</h3>

<p>The microchip 11AA010 uses a manchester serial protocoll (in short: a self synchronizing serial protocoll, where the bit encoding is done by a change from low/high or high/low instead of the high/low states itself).</p>

<p>In general the emulation are three state machines, 
<ul><li>
<p>one lowlevel "machine"<br>
the low level in general handles the initial syncing needed for later "synchronized" communication</p>
</li><li>
<p>one midlevel "machine"<br>
which emulate atomic commands-steps (like MAK, SAK, reading a bit...) </p>
</li><li>
<p>one highlevel "machine"<br>
which emulates complete commands, which consist of several atomic commands</p>
</li></ul>
</p>

<p>Input/output is basically done via the lineIn and lineOut functions. Both functions in itself do not trigger any further actions.</p>

<p>You can view current emulation status by opening a "cartridge" window (in dissi type "carti").</p>
