<p>Vector information window.<br>
Here you can see some data of a selected vector. The data shown are:
<ul><li>
<p>on the first line you see the currently drawn count of vectors<br>
The count is related to the display routine though - which means patterned vectors are not counted as one vector, but are counted by how many times the light is switched on or off - this will NOT be fixed - this is a feature not a bug :-)!</p>
</li><li>
<p>the coordinates </p>
</li><li>
<p>a tooltip displays the distance</p>
</li><li>
<p>intensity of the vector</p>
</li><li>
<p>the PC where the ~BLANK signal became 1 (when the vector was finished drawing)</p>
</li><li>
<p>and the callstack at that time</p>
</li><li>
<p>double click on PC will initiate jump to that address in dissi</p>
</li><li>
<p>double click on a callstack address will initiate jump to that address in dissi</p>
</li></ul>
</p>

<p>Notice:<br>
The callstack is not the contents of the stack!<br>
The callstack only has "subroutine"-return-adresses!<br>
Callstack is only available if "collect vector information" is enabled in the configuration.</p>

<p><b>Mouse</b><br>
Below the callstack, while moving over the emulation window, you can see the mouse-coordinates displayed. These coordinates are calculated to represent the actual integrator values needed for that position. This means the mouse coordinates are displayed in vectrex integrator/coordinates.</p>
