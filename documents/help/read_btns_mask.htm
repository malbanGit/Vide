<p>Read_Btns ($F1BA)</p>

<p>Both of these routines read the button states on the two
joysticks, and return their state in the following RAM locations:
</p>

<p>joystick 1, <br>
button 1: $C812 = $01<br>
button 2: $C813 = $02<br>
button 3: $C814 = $04<br>
button 4: $C815 = $08</p>

<p>joystick 2,<br>
button 1: $C816 = $10<br>
button 2: $C817 = $20<br>
button 3: $C818 = $40<br>
button 4: $C819 = $80</p>

<p>C80F:<br>
Contains current state of all buttons;</p>

<p>1 = depressed, 0 = not depressed</p>

<p>C810:<br>
Contains state of all buttons from LAST time these routines were
called; if Read_Btns_Mask was called, then this is AND'ed with
the passed in mask. </p>

<p>C811:<br>
Contains the same information as $C812-$C819</p>

<pre>Bit 7 		  Bit 0</pre>

        <td>2.1</td>
        <td>1.4</td>

<p>If Read_Btns is called, the result will be the same as
Read_Btns_Mask with a mask of $FF1, and a 1 will only be returned
if the button has transitioned to being pressed. </p>

<p>If Read_Btns_Mask is called, then a mask, passed in in the
A-reg will be used to determine how the button state info is
returned: </p>

<p>If a bit is 0, then the current state of the button is to be
returned in the appropriate RAM location; 0 = not pressed, and 1
= pressed. </p>

<p>If a bit is 1, then the appropriate RAM location is set to 1
only on the depression transition of the button; additional calls
will return 0, until the button is released and then depressed
again. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>ENTRY:</p>

<p>DP = $D0</p>

<p>A-reg = mask (for Read_Btns_Mask only)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>EXIT:</p>

<p>A-reg = button transition state (same as $C811)</p>

<p>B-reg, X-reg trashed</p>
