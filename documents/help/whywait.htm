(Optimization warning)</p>

<p>I'm not really sure. But I suspect the hardware not to react
immediately to changes in VIA registers/bits. VIA itself needs 1-2
cycles to initiate shifting and/or timing. Some things go through
the MUX and others are negated along the way to their final
destination (~RAMP/~ZERO). I experienced some timing problems
optimizing Vectrex Frogger. I changed the above line routine to
be a bit faster for my purposes. Since in Vectrex Frogger all
'sprites' are drawn using a scale factor of 6, which is the timer
low counter, I thought that after 6 cycles from switching the
timer on I could switch the light off, without a request loop,
and the line would be drawn all right. This is not so. I think
somewhere in the vectrex hardware there is a delay of a couple of
cycles before the signals reach their final destination (the
integration hardware, in opposite to their first destination, the
VIA registers/flags). And furthermore, that these delays are not
the same for all operations, since everything would again be
alright. I guess, for example, the ~RAMP enabling somehow takes
more time than ~BLANK enabling. I have not done really many tests
on that, perhaps some day I will. When optimizing vectrex
programs keep this in mind and test timing critical routines
carefully. There are some situations where you can easily change
some registers to early, theoretically the results would be ok,
but in reality vectrex will draw something weirdly different. The
vector drawing and positioning routines have great potential for
optimization, but be careful! </p>
