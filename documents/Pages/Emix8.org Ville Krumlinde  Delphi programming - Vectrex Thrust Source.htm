</p><h1>Vectrex Thrust Source code</h1><br><h2>Introduction</h2>Here is the complete source code for my game <a href="http://www.emix8.org/static.php?page=VectrexThrust">Vectrex Thrust</a>.
 This game would never have been possible to write without all the 
information people have shared on the web, so releasing this source code
 is my way of giving something back and hoping that someone will find it
 useful.<br><br>I'm not good at writing documentation, but I figure 
releasing the source code without any kind of helping information won't 
help anyone so I'm just writing down the things I would think need 
explaining. This document is more of a FAQ than a complete 
documentation. Just email me, or post a comment if you need more 
information.<br><br><h2>Getting started with Vectrex development</h2>The
 Vectrex is a really great choice of platform when writing a game for a 
retro console. It is easy to get started, and the hardware is not 
complicated compared to other consoles and computers from the early 
eighties. The Vector graphics gives the games an unique look which does 
not feel as dated as a low-res bitmapped display (although speaking of 
what is 'dated' is probably besides the point when discussing 
retrogaming). <br><br>A good set of links and documentation is at <a href="http://www.vectrex.nl/" target="_blank">www.vectrex.nl</a>.<br>The AS09 assembler by <a href="http://www.kingswood-consulting.co.uk/assemblers/" target="_blank">Frank A. Vorstenbosch</a>.<br>The 6809-port of the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/gcc6809/" target="_blank">GCC compiler</a>.<br><br><h2>Building and testing Vectrex Thrust</h2>To assemble the source code to a binary you need a 6809 assembler.<br><br>I developed Vectrex Thrust on a Windows XP computer using the 'AS09' assembler by Frank A. Vorstenbosch, available here: <a href="http://www.kingswood-consulting.co.uk/assemblers/" target="_blank">http://www.kingswood-consulting.co.uk/assemblers/</a><br><br>NOTE:
 I used version 1.32 of AS09. There are compatibility problems with the 
later 1.40 version. I've emailed Frank about this. Send a email to me if
 you need the 1.32 version.<br><br>Put AS09.exe in the same file as the Thrust Source code and run the batch file 'm.bat' to assemble the binary:<br>'m.bat'    Assembles the source files into thrust.bin<br>'m.bat 1'  Also generate detailed listing file thrust.lst<br><br>After you have a binary (thrust.bin) you can test it by running 'r.bat'. The batch file takes an optional parameter:<br>'r.bat'    Starts the game with the MESS-emulator<br>'r.bat 2'  Starts the game with the VecX-emulator<br>'r.bat 3'  Uploads the game to the VecRAM using veccy-win32.exe<br>'r.bat 4'  Starts the game with the VecXMod-emulator<br><br>Be aware that r.bat uses hardcoded paths so you need to change them to your own environment.<br><br><br><h2>Source code organisation</h2>I've
 tried to keep the code readable and in separate modules. I've even 
written some comments :)  There may be a couple of comments that are in 
Swedish, just email me if you need it translated or better explained.<br><br>The files:<br><br>Thrust.asm - Main program<br>Thrust_BonusGame.asm - Code for the hidden bonus game<br>Thrust_Eeprom.asm - Eeprom support (by Alex Herbert)<br>Thrust_Fx.asm - Graphical effects<br>Thrust_Levels.asm - Level maps<br>Thrust_Music.asm - Music player code and data<br>Thrust_Ship.asm - Code for controlling the ship and pod<br>Thrust_Sound.asm - Sound effects<br>Thrust_Text.asm - Text constants and menu code<br>Thrust_Title.asm - Title screen<br>Clip.asm - Line clipping subroutine<br>Clip.c - Line clipping C source code<br>Clip.h - Line clipping C header file<br>Def.asm - Macros, constants, structures and RAM-layout.<br><br><br><h2>Thrust world coordinate system</h2>The
 game uses an 16-bit X and Y coordinate system with the Y-axis pointing 
downwards. Negative Y is the area of empty space above planet and is 
represented by blinking stars. <br><br><a href="javascript:openpopup('/images/vecSource1.gif',800,600,false);"><img src="Emix8.org%20Ville%20Krumlinde%20%20Delphi%20programming%20-%20Vectrex%20Thrust%20Source-Dateien/vecSource1.gif" alt="" border="0"></a><br><br><br><h2>Level data format</h2>I considered several ways of organising the level data. Each one had pros and cons.<br><br>Vector based<br>+ This would seem to be the natural choice for a vectrex game :)<br>+ Compact ROM-memory footprint<br>- How to do collision?<br>- How to organize data so that the set of visible lines can be found quickly?<br>Tile based<br>+ Set of visible lines can be computed in constant time<br>+ Collision tests of objects against walls in constant time<br>+ No need for writing a level editor, levels can be written directly with 'db' statments in the assembler source<br>- Large levels take lots of ROM-space<br>- Each tile is drawn separately, producing dots at tile edges<br><br>By
 'constant time' I mean 'does not increase with complexity of current 
view or level size'. This was important to me because I wanted to be 
certain that the code was fast enough for handling large levels (like 
level 6 in the original game) without slowing down too much.<br><br>In 
the end I settled for a tile based design. The main reason being that I 
had more experience working with tiles and that the other solution would
 require more research. When I got a tile based code drawing a small 
test level, I knew it would work with larger levels also. I felt that a 
vector based approach would end up more complicated with more states and
 code paths, which is a bad thing when writing assembler code without a 
debugger. So quite simply: I was lazy :)<br><br>See the file 'Thrust_Levels.asm'.<br><br><br><h2>The music</h2>Vectrex
 Thrust uses the original music and music player written by the great 
Rob Hubbard for the Atari ST version of Thrust. I disassembled the 68000
 binary using AssemPro for Atari ST, and then translated the assembler 
code by hand. The player could probably be reused to play other Atari ST
 music by Rob Hubbard, like from the game Warhawk.<br><br>An example from the source file Thrust_Music. The original 68000 code is commented out and the 6809 translation follows:<br><code><br>        ; ANDI.B #$F,D0<br>        ; SUB.B D0,$34(A1)<br>        ; BPL.S L05947A<br>  anda #$f<br>  ldb $34,x<br>  pshs a<br>  subb ,s+<br>  stb $34,x<br>  bpl L05947A<br>        ; CLR.B $34(A1)<br>  lda #0<br>  sta $34,x<br>  ...and so on<br></code><br>It
 is pretty much a line for line conversion, slightly more verbose in 
6809 because of the limited instruction set and registers. Also the 
32-bit adresses and counters of the original is shortened to 16-bits to 
save rom-space. That the conversion is at all possible is due to the 
fact that Atari ST and Vectrex have compatible sound chip hardware.<br><br><br><h2>Stack usage</h2>One macro is used in almost every subroutine, from Def.asm:<br><code><br>;Declare local stack frame.<br>;  s1 nr of 1-byte locals,<br>;  s2 nr of 2-byte locals<br>;  bufsize is size of extra buffer (can be omitted)<br>;Locals are named Local1B etc for byte, Local1W for word, buffer is named LocalBuffer.<br>mDecLocals macro s1,s2,bufsize<br></code><br>This is a very useful macro for defining local variables. <br><br>Example of use:<br><code><br>ShowTitleScreen:<br>  ;This subroutine uses 7 local byte sized variables named LocalB[1..7]<br>  mDecLocals 7,0,0<br><br>  ;Give the locals some useful names<br>LocalTextTimer = LocalB1<br>LocalTextInt = LocalB2<br>LocalMusicTimer = LocalB3<br>LocalVolumeTimer = LocalB4<br>LocalMode = LocalB5<br>LocalModeClock = LocalB6<br>LocalBonusGame = LocalB7<br><br>  ...<br>  ;Code using the local vars<br>  tst LocalBonusGame,s<br>  ...<br><br>  ;End of subroutine, remove stack frame  <br>  mFreeLocals<br>  rts<br></code><br><br><br><h2>Drawing a scrolling landscape</h2><br><img src="Emix8.org%20Ville%20Krumlinde%20%20Delphi%20programming%20-%20Vectrex%20Thrust%20Source-Dateien/vecSource2.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Thrust
 uses a scrolling game world. It is not constantly scrolling, instead it
 detects when the ship is close to the screen border and starts 
scrolling the view until the ship is again at a preset minimum distance 
to the border.<br><br>Here is an explanation of the routines involved in drawing the landscape.<br><br>SetView()<br>This routine does the following:<br>- If currently scrolling then update ViewX/Y pair<br>- Else check if ship is close to screen border, if so then start scrolling<br>The NeedRefresh byte is set if the view coordinated are changed.<br><br>RefreshDrawList()<br>This is probably the largest subroutine in the game. Here is some pseudo code of what it is doing:<br><br>Test the NeedRefresh byte, exit if not set<br>Determine the set of visible tiles using the ViewX/Y pair.<br>For each visible tile<br>  if tile needs clipping (a border tile)<br>    set up parameters and call clip-subroutine<br>    the clip-subroutine writes clipped lines to DrawList-memory<br>  else<br>    copy lines of tile to DrawList-memory<br>Write a zero to DrawList to mark end of list<br>DrawList now contains the set of visible lines for the current screen.<br>DrawLevel()<br>Call GoDrawList() with DrawList-memory as parameter<br>GoDrawList()
 simply draws every line in the drawlist, these are in screen 
coordinates so they can be drawn directly without processing.<br><br>The
 DrawList-memory is kept between frames if the view is not scrolling, 
this saves a lot of cpu time since RefreshDrawList() can simply exit: 
the visible lines are the same as last frame.<br><br><br><h2>Clipping</h2>The
 lines of the tiles at the screen border needs to be clipped from 
world-coordinates into screen coordinates. A general 2d line clipping 
routine is quite slow as it uses division. Fortunately it can be very 
specialized to match the requirements for Thrust. We can hardcode it to 
handle three types of lines: <br>- Vertical<br>- Horizontal<br>- Fixed 22.5 degree slope<br>Clipping
 these kinds of lines is trivial. Vertical and horizontal just need to 
check that the max x or y coordinate is lower than the allowed clipping 
region. A sloped line needs a bit more work: shorten the line in the 
x-direction with half the clipped amount of the y-direction (and the 
other way around). A sloped line in a screen corner may need to clip 
both ends. I started with a general Cohen-Sutherland clipping code I 
found on the internet and then simplified it and made it work with the 
GCC for 6809 compiler. The compiler source output (gcc09 -S) was then 
saved to Clip.asm. Line clipping is also used by the hidden bonus game.<br><br><br><h2>Collision detection</h2><br>The PointVsLevel subroutine in Thrust.asm handles collision against planet walls.<br>Parameters:<code><br>  ;x and y are coords to test (world coordinates)<br>  ;returns carry set if collision<br></code><br>Exact
 tests can be made by looking up what tile is at X/Y and then call the 
collision subroutine for that particular tile, passing along the 
coordinates relative to the top left corner of the tile. Because of the 
limitation in line types (horizontal, vertical or fixed slope) 
determining if collision has occurred within a tile is simple.<br><br>This image shows three different tiles and subroutines.<br><img src="Emix8.org%20Ville%20Krumlinde%20%20Delphi%20programming%20-%20Vectrex%20Thrust%20Source-Dateien/vecSource3.gif" alt="" border="0"><br>There
 is a total of fifteen different tile collision subroutines used in the 
game.Six of these are for handling tiles that contains sliding doors.<br><br>Collision
 tests between sprites are made with simple rectangle intersections 
tests. See the macro mTestAreaVsArea defined in Def.asm and example of 
usage in Thrust_Ship.asm.<br><br><h2>Demo mode</h2>Thrust uses recorded 
gameplay for the demomode. I downloaded the source for the VecX emulator
 and modified it to record the joystick and button state. When the 
emulator exits it dumps the recorded data to a textfile which can be 
inserted in a assembler file.<br><br>Vecxmod.exe is the modified binary.
 Thrust needs to be assembled with a special flag set when recording 
input, set DemoRecord=1 in Def.asm. This makes Thrust call an illegal 
6809 opcode once every frame during gameplay. Vecxmod catches this 
special opcode and records the input. This way no "noise" input needs to
 be removed afterwards, only gameplay input is dumped to the file.<br><br>See the file Thrust_Ship.asm for how the demo data is used:<br><code><br>;Recorded demo data<br>;First two bytes: start level, reserved<br>DemoData1:<br> db 0,0<br> db $00, $0b, $10, $07, $00, $01, $0c, $07, $20, $09, $2c, $0c, $0c, $0a, $2c, $03<br> db $20, $08, $21, $00, $00, $08, $01, $00, $00, $05, $10, $00, $00, $00, $01, $00<br> ...<br></code><br>The
 format is: inputbits, inputcount. Inputbits is one byte holding the 
state of joystick one and the four buttons. Inputcount is the nr of 
frames this state is valid.<br> <br><br><h2>Credits</h2>Source and documentation by Ville Krumlinde.<br>EEPROM (highscore battery backup) code by Alex Herbert.<br>Music code and data originally by Rob Hubbard<br>Clever frame interval test routine by Thomas Jentzsch.<br><br>Vectrex Thrust logo by Manu Pärssinen.<br><br>Beta testers: Thomas Jentzsch, Manu Pärssinen, Mark Shaker, Alex Herbert and Rob Mitchell.<br><br><br><h2>Download source</h2>:: <a href="http://www.emix8.org/files/vectrex/VectrexThrust_Source.zip">Download Vectrex Thrust  source code (89 kb)</a><br clear="all">
