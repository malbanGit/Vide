<p>Do_Sound_x ($F28C)</p>

<p>This routine will start/continue making the sound which was
first set up by your call to Init_Music. This routine should
normally be called right after your call to Wait_Recal. It takes
the next music information, contained in the music buffer
$C83F-$C84C, and updates only those registers which differ from
the last data written to the sound chip. </p>
