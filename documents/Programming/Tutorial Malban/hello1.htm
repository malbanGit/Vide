<p>Well, the usual first, most simple program!</p>

<p>Vectrex is capable of displaying simple texts on its screen.
The easiest way to display a simple message is to use the ROM
routines. For this example we will only use three BIOS functions.
</p>

<p>The text display function we will use is called Print_Str_d
($F37A). It requires the direct page register to be set to $d0.
It also requires 3 parameters: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>U-reg points to string list<br>
    A-reg = relative Y position<br>
    B-reg = relative X position<br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The second used BIOS function is responsible for a clean
display. It is called Wait_Recal ($F192). This function should be
called every 'display round'. It waits for a certain period of
time, recalibrates the vector hardware, sets the pen to zero
position and so on. It also sets DP to D0, so we don't have to do
it. The BIOS default time to wait is 30000 cycles, which will
display our vectors 50 times per second (if we have enough time).
</p>

<p>So he above function destroys some inner settings, as well as
cleaning some others. The 'Wait_Recal' call is necessary for example to set
the intensity after each round. This is not immediately obvious, since
the program runs well on any vectrex - for a minute or so. But
slowly the intensity information will 'drift' towards zero. After
1 or 2 minutes you won't see our 'HELLO WORLD' any more if we do
not set the intensity. There are BIOS functions for this. For the
easiness of the example we pick a fixed intensity function,
Intensity_5F ($F2A5). This function (quite obviously) sets the
intensity to $5f, which is fairly bright, but not maximum ($7f). </p>

<p>We don't have to worry about uninitialized BIOS stuff, because
there is no such thing. When vectrex boots up it first
initializes itself and its BIOS, so some default values are
always present, like the above timer or a default text size. In
this first example we do not change any of the default settings. </p>

<p>Here a screenshot:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="hello1.gif" align="absmiddle"

<p>Here is a source code to a most simple 'HELLO WORLD':</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><a href="hello1.asm">hello1.asm</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>OK, let's start at the top of the source. First thing we do is
to set some defines, so the source looks a bit more intuitive.
You will probably know such things. Every modern
compiler/assembler will allow defining of constants. In the next
examples this section will be replaces by an 'include' directive,
which (as you might have guessed) includes all possible global
definitions. In this example we tell the assembler what ROM
addresses our function names represent (sorry about being to
obvious). </p>

<p>Vectrex 'programs' (roms) always start at location 0. The
first thing we need is a copyright information of GCE, &quot;g
GCE&quot;. This string MUST be present in order for your program
to work, the BIOS checks for it. If the above string is not found
it will boot with minestorm instead! The string can be followed
by any string you like. </p>

<p>NOTE: only capital letters are supported, small letters
represent special characters (like the copyright sign) (see <a
href="appendixe.htm">appendix E</a>). Strings must always be
terminates with a $80. Following that $80 is a word pointer to a
music structure. I won't go into music structures at this point.
For now it is enough to know that in the vectrex BIOS ROM 13
pieces of music are integrated. Music1 is the power-on music,
Crazy Coaster and Narrow Escape. Following is a 4 byte structure
describing the format of the following text. First value is the
height of the text. This is -8, since the text goes from top to
bottom, than the width (positive, from left to right). Followed
by the (not relative) coordinates Y, X. Than the string itself
follows, terminated by a $80. It would be possible to include
some other structures like this one (height, width, Y, X,
&quot;STRING&quot;, $80). The game header finishes of with a 0. </p>

<p>The byte following after the 0 is the first byte of code.
Since we don't want to initialize anything we go right into our
display loop from the start. The following steps are repeated
eternally.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>* At first we do call the BIOS function Wait_Recal,
    calling this function at the beginning of every display round
    insures a stable image (amongst other things). Since the
    function does not expect any values and does not return
    anything, a call is at this point enough. </p>
    <p>* We than have to make sure our intensity stays the same
    even after a Wait_Recal call. We call the function
    Intensity_5F ($F2A5), which does exactly that. It sets the
    vector intensity (brightness) to $5f. </p>
    <p>* Next thing we do is prepare the call of the text display
    function Print_Str_d. We load the U register with the address
    of the to be displayed text. Since we just called Wait_Recal
    our position on the vectrex screen should currently be known
    and 0, 0. We load the relative Y coordinate to A. We load the
    relative X coordinate to B. Since we just called Wait_Recal
    we also know that DP is pointing to D0, which is required by
    Print_Str_d. Thus we have prepared all there is for
    Print_Str_d. </p>
    <p>* Now let us call Print_Str_d. The text is displayed on
    the screen. We are done with drawing the screen. Since that
    is all we want our program to do we are finished at this
    point. The only thing left to do is to make sure that the
    screen gets repainted constantly, so we </p>
    <p>* jump back to the top, and do everything again. At the
    end of the source is our &quot;HELLO WORLD&quot; string
    (again terminated by a $80). </p>

<p>Done! This is your first running vectrex program! Wasn't hard
was it?</p>
