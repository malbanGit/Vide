<p><font size="5"><strong>Optimization for Vectrex Programs</strong></font></p>

<p>First, for some further information on this subject look at
the 'vectors' section, the source for Vectrex Frogger and at the
'progger.txt' file included with Vectrex Frogger. </p>

<p>This will not be a full blown section of its own. I'll just
give some tips and tricks I encountered/used. This is by no means
complete. Perhaps some of it is even wrong, who knows, I'm not a
pro, remember, I just write down some thoughts I have/had. </p>

<p>General optimization techniques apply, as searching for good
algorithms to do something instead of making up something on the
fly. General assembler techniques are not really looked into in
depth. Look at an assembler book for that. </p>

<p>In all programming ever done you will encounter two ways of
optimizing. One way for speed, the other for size. Both ways are
usually mutual exclusive. I'll just go into the speed area a bit.
The first vectrex programmers probably had to look after the size
of their programs as well as the speed. But at RAM (ROM/EPROM
that is) prices as they are today we don't really need to be
concerned about space. We have 32KB we can fill with stuff. 32KB
assembler programs for a 6809 processor really take some time to
code. </p>

<p>First thing you might want to look for in your program are
what sections need optimizing. There is, for example, no need to
speed optimize the initialization code. It probably doesn't
matter if you initialize the next level in a hundreds or a tenth
of a second. This is usually a place where you might think of
space optimization instead of speed. </p>

<p>The part of the code which has to run 50 times per second is
another thing, here we are entering code that might be worth a
second look. Even more interesting are sections of code which run
many times per update round. Like vector positioning/drawing
code. Perhaps collision detection stuff. Well, there is no
general description of what code might be executed that is worth
optimizing, you'll need some feeling for it. Don't worry, you'll
know where to optimize once you start with your program. </p>

<p>The way I usually go about writing a program is:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>- think about it<br>
    - program it in the most easy and intuitive way possibly<br>
    - test/change till it works alright<br>
    - start optimizing<br>
    - repeat the last two steps, till satisfied<br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are probably many people who'll say, do it the right way
(optimized) right at start. I don't think so, I find that very
cumbersome. </p>

<p>Anyway, do what you want, as you will do so anyway. Here are
some points I would like to share:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>- once the code is stable remove JSR/RTS, especially where
    called many times per update round, each JSR/RTS takes 12
    cycles<br>
    <br>
    - use macros instead of subroutines, they are equal in easy
    changeability, but faster<br>
    <br>
    - at the end of your program check if there might be some
    loop unrolling be done, at places this might save you many
    cycles (vector lists, look at Vectrex Frogger for an example)<br>
    <br>
    - if the last thing in a subroutine is the calling of another
    subroutine, you can as well jump there, this saves a couple
    of cycles (and space)<br>
    <br>
    - if you can, avoid long branches, they take longer and take
    two bytes more of space, since their are second page opcodes<br>
    <br>
    - if you can, avoid Y register usage, cause this one is too,
    a second page opcode, it takes longer and uses more space<br>
    <br>
    - when finalizing your code, sort you code section, look
    where you access what RAM/VIA area most, and set the DP
    register accordingly, you can really save cycles this way and
    SPACE. I found it convenient to use a macro for changing the
    DP register, since you can place a 'direct' pseudo opcode
    within that macro<br>
    <br>
    - if you can, do a LDD instead of LDA, LDB, it saves space
    and cycles, this often occurs when loading Y, X coordinates,
    and different values for PIA registers<br>
    <br>
    - look at the *.lst file the assembler creates (with the
    correct options), you will clearly see where you waste cycles
    and space<br>
    <br>
    - create a macro library of BIOS routines you use often,
    perhaps optimize the routines for your needs, the BIOS
    routines are quite broad in their functionality, you usually
    use only some parts of them, remove the unused part in you
    macros (look at the other documents, and Vectrex Frogger
    makros)<br>
    <br>
    - at all costs, if possible avoid BIOS 'print_str' routines,
    they are born cycle wasters! One string printed can easily
    take 10,000 cycles!<br>
    <br>
    - remember to switch of unused joystick stuff, each joystick
    direction test takes a few hundred cycles (or so)<br>
    <br>
    - if not really necessary, use digital joystick settings
    instead of analogous </p>
