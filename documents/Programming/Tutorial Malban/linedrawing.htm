<p><font size="5"><strong>Line Drawing</strong></font></p>

<p>By now you'll probably have noticed, that vectrex programming
(using the BIOS) is not all that complicated. Drawing lines
follows the same scheme as above examples. We think of some
coordinates, put them into appropriate registers and call a
function every display round. Drawing figures made of vectors is
exactly the same. We keep a list of vector coordinates in memory
and again call a function for displaying them. The length of
vectors, as already described above can be varied by two
different parameters, the strength of a vector and the time of
drawing (scaling). </p>

<p>There are different kinds of vector display functions. Mainly
these functions can be sorted by their 'supportiveness'. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>1. drawing only one vector<br>
    2. drawing a list of vectors<br>
    a. including positioning information<br>
    b. excluding positioning information<br>
    i. including scaling information<br>
    ii. excluding scaling information<br>
    #1. including brightness information<br>
    #2. excluding brightness information<br>
    #a. including mode information *<br>
    #b. excluding mode information *<br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>* mode means here, that a line can be draw using e.g. patterns
and other conditional information </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For more information on each function look at the appropriate
function description in <a href="appendixa.htm">Appendix A</a>.
In the following examples I'll first introduce a single line
program, and later a program for displaying a vector list. </p>

<p>Following BIOS functions support line drawing:</p>

<p>Now the first example:</p>

<p>Here a screenshot:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="line1.gif" width="321" height="471"></p>

<p><a href="line1.asm">line1.asm</a></p>

<p>In the example we assume (correctly) that the Wait_Recal sets
DP to D0. First we set a scale factor we want to use for our
vector ($80). As we already know, scale factor is a VIA register,
timer1 low byte. Than we set the start coordinate, actually this
is a relative coordinate. We know that the Wait_Recal routine
sets the beam to the (0,0) position. We use that position as our
starting position. NOTE: You must set some starting position with
a positioning function. You can not use the (0,0) from Wait_Recal
directly. Wait_Recal does some weird stuff, that doesn't allow us
to use the positioning given by it directly (when drawing with a
standard line function)! </p>

<p>After positioning the vector beam to (0,0) we set the
intensity (brightness) to $5f (reason... see dot plotting :-)).
From (Fred's) description of the Draw_Line_d routine we know that
the routine is actually part of the Draw_VL subroutine, which is
used to plot a number of vectors. That number is stored in the
Vec_Misc_Count RAM location. Therefore we must insure that only
one vector is plotted. We do that by poking 0 to that location </p>

<p>(Note, the BIOS always ensures this location is 0 before
returning, if you don't change that location in your program,
than there is no need to clear this location). </p>

<p>Than we set the end position of the vector (relative to the
position we are at now) (the start position is already known
(0,0)). Register A stores the Y position and register B the X
position. These positions are the 'translated' strength of the
vector. The beam internally is drawn for a fixed amount of time
(the scale value) in the direction specified by the Y, X
position. The position is internally translated to a voltage with
which the electron beam is deflected from the center of the tube.</p>

<p>Anyway, after setting the end position we are ready to call the
'Draw_Line_d' subroutine. After that we are already finished
with everything we need to do for drawing a single line, so we go
back to the beginning for repainting! </p>

<p>(NOTE:</p>

<p>What strange 'thing' the Wait_Recal does: </p>

<p>It calls right at the end 'Reset0Ref'!</p>

<p><font face="Fixedsys">Reset0Ref: </font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font face="Fixedsys">LDD #$00CC<br>
    STB VIA_cntl ;/BLANK low, /ZERO low</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<p>That means, that both /BLANK AND /ZERO are enabled (0). This
means that the vector beam is always on center (zero). This is
true until the VIA_cntl is modified so that the /ZERO flag is
high again. The simple 'Draw_Line_d' function does not do this,
'Moveto_d' does however, thus the above construct works ok. </p>

<p>You could instead of the 'Moveto_d' function call also insert
the following two lines, which do only the stuff we need:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font face="Fixedsys">LDA #$CE ;/Blank low, /ZERO high<br>
    STA VIA_cntl<br>
    </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>NOTE 2:</p>

<p>/Blank, /ZERO are both low active.)</p>

<p>The second example:</p>

<p>Now let us draw a couple of lines. Most programs for vectrex
will sooner or later require 'combined' line objects. We call
these combined lines - vector lists. There are a couple of list
types, as you might imagine looking at the above listed assortment
of vector plotting routines. The next example will introduce the
most simple form of vector lists. The others are not really much
more complicated, but it would be a waste of effort to dig to
deeply into them with this document, so they are left out as an
exercise for the reader, to go out and explore the BIOS function
description. Here comes the next example: </p>

<p>Here a screenshot:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="line2.gif" width="321" height="471"></p>

<p><a href="line2.asm">line2.asm</a></p>

<p>OK... here we go again. You'll immediately see, that the
program follows the same scheme as all other programs before. It
is nearly the same as the last program. Just one function call is
different, with different parameters, and of course the data of
the vector list. Therefore I'll from now on only describe the
differences to the last program, not the whole program anymore.
The new function in this example is Draw_VL ($F3DD). The function
name is a short form of 'Draw Vector List'. This is exactly what
it does. It requires just one parameter which is passed in the X
register. This is a pointer to the address of the vector list to
be drawn. We pass at this stage the address of our list, which is
'turtle_line_list' (the vector list is taken from Vectrex
Frogger). The list is very easily constructed, the first byte
found at that address is taken as the count, how many vectors
make up this list, MINUS 1! (the routine tests for how long the
decrement of the count is positive, thus we need a minus 1 here)
After the count follow the line 'coordinates'. These
'coordinates' are the same 'vector strength`s' we encountered in
the one line version. All of these 'coordinates' are relative to
the last relevant position. Thus in the above example the first
line will be drawn from 0, 0 (from the Moveto_d, btw the
Wait_Recal function) to 2, 2 (equally to the upper right). The
next line is drawn from 2, 2 to relative -1, 2. To absolute these
coordinates you must add the coordinates. The line`s 'real'
coordinates would thus be:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>line 1 start 0, 0 end: 2, 2<br>
    line 2 start: 2, 2 end: (2-1), (2+2) this is 1, 4<br>
    line 3 start: 1, 4 end: (1+2), (4+1) this is 3, 5<br>
    ...<br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>To visualize that:</p>

<p><img src="lines.gif" width="130" height="200"></p>

<p>Ooops, that looks pretty bad, but perhaps you get the point.
In the above example you encounter a constant factor in the
vector list, here called SPRITE_BLOW_UP. This is just an idea I
had at one time to examine the effect of scale factors and vector
strengths. Using a definable constant helps to change the
strengths of the vectors very easily. In the above example the
vectors actually have strengths of factors of 25 (-125, -100,
-75, -50, -25 0, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125). We can pretty easily
control the size of our objects without using the scale factor.
For the above program I ran a little test. The program as listed
above, SPRITE_BLOW_UP = 25 and scale factor of $10, uses per
update round exactly 3158 cycles. If we change the scale factor
to $50 and set the SPRITE_BLOW_UP to 5, which gives us an object
of exactly the same size, we need already 4705 cycles! This does
not look like much, but keep in mind, that with just one object
you will not be able to create great programs. And that you will
also want a pretty fast round, below 30,000 cycles to have a
steady image. </p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>There are also vector list routines, which have a 'mode' or
'pattern' byte. With these routines you are able to draw
invisible lines, therefore objects are possible, that are not
drawn in one go. </p>

<p>Note: </p>

<p>There are also functions, that provide collision detection of
vector lists. And there are functions with which you can rotate
and scale your vectors as need arise. I won't go into these,
'cause they go (IMHO) beyond the scale of a little introduction
to vectrex programming. The day you might need them will be the
day you don't need an introduction anymore :-). </p>
