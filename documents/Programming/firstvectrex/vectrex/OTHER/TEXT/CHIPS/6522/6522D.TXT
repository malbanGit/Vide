Summarised by Olaf Seibert, from "Programming the PET/CBM" (by Raeto Collin
West) chapter 14, The Transactor, Volume 4 Issue 05, and articles posted by
Veit Laule.

PIA 6520 and VIA 6522
---------------------

In the PET, you find the two PIAs at E810 and E820, and the VIA at E840.

The PIA
-------
The PIA has two 8-bit I/O ports, A and B, which are mostly identical in
function.  All 8 bits can be set to input (1 in the DDR) or output (0 in
the DDR) independently. Bit 2 in CRx determines whether the DDRx or Px are
accessed.  Each port has 2 control lines: CA1, CA2, CB1, CB2. The Cx1 are
input only, the Cx2 can be input or output.

PIAs have two interrupt lines: IRQA and IRQB. They may go low on a change
on the inputs of the Cxy lines. These interrupts may be enabled on either
an 1->0 or an 0->1 transition. The selected transition is called the
"active" transition. The flags which register that an active transition has
occurred are reset by reading the appropriate PORT register.

Register map:

E810  PORT A or DDR A: Data Direction Register A
E811  CRA: Control Register A
E812  PORT B or DDR B: Data Direction Register B
E813  CRB: Control Register B

 7    CA1 active transition flag. 1= 0->1, 0= 1->0
 6    CA2 active transition flag. 1= 0->1, 0= 1->0
 5    CA2 direction           1 = out        | 0 = in
                    ------------+------------+---------------------
 4    CA2 control   Handshake=0 | Manual=1   | Active: High=1 Low=0
 3    CA2 control   On Read=0   | CA2 High=1 | IRQ on=1, IRQ off=0
                    Pulse  =1   | CA2 Low=0  |
 2    Port A control: DDRA = 0, IORA = 1
 1    CA1 control: Active High = 1, Low = 0
 0    CA1 control: IRQ on=1, off = 0

CRB works identical for CB1 and CB2, except for the differences in
handshaking.

The Cx2 handshake is not identical between ports. For port A, the handshake
is on reading the PORT A register, for CB2 the handshake is sent on writing
the PORT B register.

On the listening side:

BIT 3 LOW with CA2: CA2 is now controlled by two events:
    (i) CA1 active transition sets it high ("Data Valid")
    (ii) a READ operation sets it low ("Data Accepted").

On the talking side:

BIT 3 LOW with CB2: CB2 is now controlled by two events:
    (i) CB1 active transition sets it high ("Ready For Data")
    (ii) a WRITE operation sets it low ("Data Valid").

Bit 2 HIGH: Causes pulse output, CA2 or CB2 going low for one cycle only
after a read or write operation. This pulse may be too short for some uses.

For operation with a sending and a receiving PIA one would connect

------      --------
Port B   -> Port A
CB2      -> CA1 with active = 1->0 (data valid)
CB1     <-  CA2 with active = 1->0 (data accepted and ready for more)

Use of PIA signals in a PET:

PIA 1

E810    PORT A  7   Diagnostic sense (pin 5 on the user port)
                6   IEEE EOI in
                5   Cassette sense #2
                4   Cassette sense #1
                3-0 Keyboard row select (through 4->10 decoder)
E811    CA2         output to blank the screen (old PETs only)
                    IEEE EOI out
        CA1         cassette #1 read line
E812    PORT B  7-0 Contents of keyboard row
                    Usually all or all but one bits set.
E813    CB2         output to cassette #1 motor: 0=on, 1=off
        CB1         screen retrace detection in

PIA 2

E820    PORT A      Input buffer for IEEE data lines
E821    CA2         IEEE NDAC out
        CA1         IEEE ATN in
E822    PORT B      Output buffer for IEEE data lines
E823    CB2         IEEE DAV out
        CB1         IEEE SRQ in

The VIA
-------
The VIA is a superset of the PIA. Many of the principles apply here as
well, though the organisation is slightly different.

The VIA has two ports, PA and PB, 4 control lines C[AB][12], an 8-bit shift
register SR and 2 timers TA and TB.

Like the PIA, the Cx1 lines are input only, the Cx2 lines are I or O.

Port A has two registers. One register causes handshaking with CA1 to
happen, the other doesn't. Port B occurs in memory before port A.
There are control registers CRA, CRB, ACR, PCR, and interrupt registers IFR
and IER. The data direction registers DDRA and DDRB have their own
addresses, unlike the PIA.

I'll only describe the extra or different features.

Timers. The VIA has two 16-bit timers T1 and T2. When written to the timers
start counting down on each clock cycle, and when reaching 0000 will flag
and may cause an interrupt or other special action. When the low byte of
the timer is read, the interrupt flag is cleared. When writing to the high
byte clears the flag and starts the timer counting.

T1 has a latch register. This is a place to store the timer value before it
will be used. When T1 reaches 0, the latch value is moved into the timer so
that the countdown may begin all over again, if so enabled.

Ports. PA and PB may be latched, so that on an active transition of CA1 the
value in the PA register is retained indefinitely (or until the next active
transition on that pin), and similarly with CB1 and PB.

The shift register. This 8-bit register is connected to CB2. On command the
SR performs 8 shifts, moving 8 bits to or from CB2 one at a time. The most
significant bit is moved first (the register shifts left). The SR can be
timed by T2 and at the same rate as the 6202, using the phase 2 clock phi2.
Alternatively an external clock may time it.

It seems there are bugs in the shift register. For instance, when doing
cassette I/O, the CB2 sound, which uses the SR, must be turned off.

The ACR controls the timers, shift register and latch status of PA and PB.
(T1 has effects on pin PB7, which are not described in the book, but I
suspect they are similar to the features of the CIA in this respect. -Olaf)

ACR E84B

7-6 Timer 1 control
    0 = PB7 unused
    0 0 = one shot
    0 1 = continuous, i.e. on underflow timer restarts at latch value.
    (The following 3 lines are guessed, based on the Amiga's CIA description)
    1 = PB7 used
    1 0 = T1 underflow toggles PB7
    1 1 = T1 underflow pulses PB7
5   Timer 2 control
    0 = one shot
    1 = count set no. of PB6 pulses
4-2 Shift register control
    000 = shift reg disabled
    001 = shift in by timer 2
    010 = shift in by phi2
    011 = shift in by external clock (PB6?)
    100 = free run by timer 2 (setting for sound)
          this means keep shifting the same byte out over and over.
          T2 is hereby set to continuous mode.
    101 = shift out by timer 2
    110 = shift out by phi2
    111 = shift out by external clock (PB6?)
1   Port B latch
    0 = disabled
    1 = enabled on CB1 transition (in/out)
0   Port A latch
    0 = disabled
    1 = enabled on CA1 transition (in)

The Periheral Control Register PCR  controls the operating modes of the
control lines CA1-CB2.

PCR E84C

7-5 CB2 control
 7  direction
    1 = output
    1 0 = do handshake
    1 0 0 = on write
    1 0 1 = pulse?
    1 1 = manual CB2 control
    1 1 0 = CB1 low
    1 1 1 = CB1 high
    0 = input
    0 0 x = Active low:  1->0
    0 1 x = Active high: 0->1
    0 x 0 = Clear Interrupt condition on write of 1 in IFR or r/w of ORB
    0 x 1 = Clear Interrupt condition on write of 1 in IFR only
4   CB1 control
    0 = active transition low
    1 = active transition high
3-1 CA2 control (similar to CB2 control)
 3  direction
    1 = output
    1 0 = do handshake
    1 0 0 = on read
    1 0 1 = pulse
    1 1 = manual CA2 control
    1 1 0 = CA1 low
    1 1 1 = CA1 high
    0 = input
    0 0 x = Active low:  1->0
    0 1 x = Active high: 0->1
    0 x 0 = Clear Interrupt condition on write of 1 in IFR or r/w of ORB
    0 x 1 = Clear Interrupt condition on write of 1 in IFR only
0   CA1 control
    0 = active transition low
    1 = active transition high

The handshaking is not specifically described in the book, so I presume it
is identical to that of the PIA.

The interrupt conditions for the control lines can be cleared by writing a
1 bit in the corresponding bit in the IFR. Optionally for CA2 and CB2 it
can also be cleared by accessing the port data register.

Interrupt Flag Register IFR and Interrupt Enable Register IER. These
registers are symmetrical wrt each other. The IER enables specific
interrupts (i.e., allows an event to trigger an interrupt), and the IFR
flags if the event took place.

When writing to the IER bit 7 controls the meaning of the 1 bits in the
data: when set each 1-bit sets the interrupt enable bit, when cleared it
resets that interrupt enable bit.

IFR E84D
IER E84E

7   IFR: master flag bit: 1 when any of the other bits are set
    IER: 0 disables, 1 enables interrupts
6   Timer 1 underflow
5   Timer 2 underflow
4   CB1 active transition
3   CB2 active transition
2   Shift register full/empty
1   CA1 active transition
0   CA2 active transition

                7   1=enable, 0=disable
                6-0 enable interrupts; same bits as in IFR.
E84F    PORTA       USER PORT without CA2 handshake

Note 1: E84F is the preferred user port register, since CA2 controls screen
graphics.

Note 2: The motor is on when this line is low, and off when it is high.

Note 3: CA1 is connected to pin B of the user port. Pins B-L correspond to
port A, which is invaiably E84E. CB2 (connected to the shift register) also
connects to pin M of the user port; square wave tones (see chapter 9 of
"Programming the PET/CBM") use these facts. CB1 signals input from cassette
#2. CA2 controls screen graphics: it is configured for output, and, when
low, gives lower case characters and others. When high, the mode is upper
case and graphics.

VIA use by BASIC and KERNEL
---------------------------
T1 and T2 are used (though the T1 latch is ignored). T2 is only used for
cassette operations, to time reading and writing of bits. T1 is used to
time out the IEEE-488 bus response (before setting ST) and also with
cassette (although not to such an extent as T2). Both timers also
contribute to RND(0), but Basic 1 uses the wrong addresses for this. T1 is
also used in Basics < 4 to time the screen-scroll delay when RVS or the
left-arrow key is pressed.

Interrupts from T1 and T2 are used for cassette and IEEE handling. CB1
interrupts are also used with cassette. The kernel does not use interrupts
from CB2, SR, CA2 and CA2.

CB2 and the shift register are used for the bell sound, which exists only
in Basic 4.

RIOT 6532
---------
Source: TOuCHE manual: the keyboard for the Apple-II clone from
the Computer Hobbyvereniging Eindhoven. (They got DDRA and DDRB reversed.)

The RIOT is used at least in the diskdrives of type 2040, 3040, 4040, 8050,
8250. They contaijn two RIOTs (at $0200 and $0280) and a VIA (at $????).


The RIOT (RAM, I/O and Timer) has 128 bytes of RAM, 2 8-bit bidirectional
I/O ports, and a timer that can count down at 4 different rates.

 1      DDRA    Port A Data Direction Register
 2      PB      Port B data
 3      DDRB    Port B Data Direction Register
 4      Timer   Timer read register

15,0F   T8      8
16,10   T64     64
17,11   T1024   1024

The Data and DDR registers are as usual. The input is a buffer, the output
is a latch.

The Timer register reads out the timer value; its initial value is set by
writing into the T1..T1024 registers. Which one is used determines the
number of clock cycles between decrements of the Timer register.

The chip also has an IRQ line but the cited source does not say anything
further about it. The 8050 fdc rom usage suggests an irq is generated on
timer underflow, with no special setup required.

The User port is the second port from the left, the IEEE-488 port is
the third port. The left port is a cassette port, but cassette #1 and #2
have moved around in various models. The other port is either inside the
case for older models or at the right-hand side for newer models.
