A2. Programmable Sound Generator AY-3-8912 (from General Instruments data sheet)
------------------------------------------

Interfacing
	Bus control signals BDIR (Bus DIRection), BC2, BC1 (Bus Control 2,1) are
	generated directly by the CP1610 series of microprocessors to control
	all external and internal bus operations in the PSG. While interfacing
	to a processor other than the CP1610 would simply require simulating
	these signals, the redundancies in the PSG functions vs. bus control
	signals can be used to advantage in that only four of the eight possible
	decoded bus functions are required by the PSG. This could simplify the
	programming of the bus control signals to the following, which would
	only require that the processor generate two bus control signals (BDIR
	and BC1, with BC2 tied to +5V).

		BDIR BC1	PSG Function
		 0    0		Inactive
		 0    1		Read from PSG
		 1    0		Write to PSG
		 1    1		Latch address

Architecture
	The AY-3-8910/8912/8913 is a register oriented Programmable Sound
	Generator. Control commands are issued to the PSG by writing to 16
	registers (register addresses are expressed in octal base). Each of the
	16 registers is also readable so that the 
	microprocessor can determine present states or stored data values. All
	functions of the PSG are controlled through the 16 registers which once
	programmed, generate and sustain the sounds, thus freeing the system
	processor for other tasks.
	The basic blocks in the PSG which produce the programmed sounds include:
		Tone Generators		produce the basic square wave tone 
					frequencies for each channel (A,B,C)
		Noise Generator		produces a frequency modulated pseudo
					random pulse width square wave output
		Mixers			combine the outputs of the Tone
					Generators and the Noise Generator. One
					for each channel (A,B,C)
		Amplitude Control	provides the D/A converters with either
					fixed or variable amplitude pattern. The
					fixed amplitude is under direct CPU
					control; the variable amplitude is
					accomplished by using the output of the
					Envelope Generator.
		Envelope Generator	produces an envelope pattern which can
					be used to amplitude modulate the output
					of each mixer
		D/A Converters		the three D/A converters each produce up
					to a 16 level output signal as 
					determined by the Amplitude Control
	In addition, there are two IO ports (A and B) to interface with the
	outside world. Both ports are available on the AY-3-8910; only IO port A
	is available on the AY-3-8912; no ports are available on the AY-3-8913.

Operation
	The function of creating or programming a specific sound or sound effect
	logically follows the control sequence listed:

Tone Generator Control (registers R0,R1,R2,R3,R4,R5)
	The frequency of each square wave generated by the three Tone Generators
	(one each for Channels A, B and C) is obtained in the PSG by first
	counting down the input clock by 16, then by further counting down
	the result by the programmed 12-bit Tone Period value.
	Each 12-bit value is obtained in the PSG by combining the contents of
	the relative Coarse and Fine Tune registers: bits 0-3 of the Coarse Tune
	registers give the Most Significant bits, bits 0-7 of the Fine Tune
	registers give the Least Significant bits.

		Channel		Coarse Tune Register	Fine Tune Register
		   A			R1			R0
		   B			R3			R2
		   C			R5			R4

Noise Generator Control (register R6)
	The frequency of the noise source is obtained by first counting down the
	input clock by 16, then by further counting down the result by the
	programmed 5-bit Noise Period value. This 5-bit value consists of the
	lower 5 bits (b4-b0) of register R6.

Mixer Control - IO Enable (register R7)
	The determination of combining neither/either/both noise and tone	
	frequencies on each channel is made by the state of bits b5-b0 of R7.
	The direction (input or output) of the two general purpose IO ports is
	determined by the state of bits b7 and b6.
	These bits are active low, so a 1 disables, and a 0 enables the function

		b7 input enable IO port A
		b6 input enable IO port B
		b5 noise enable channel C
		b4 noise enable channel B
		b3 noise enable channel A
		b2 tone enable channel C
		b1 tone enable channel B
		b0 tone enable channel A

Amplitude Control (registers R10,R11,R12)
	The amplitudes of the signals generated by each of the three D/A 
	converters is determined by the contents of the lower 5 bits (b4-b0) of
	registers R10, R11 and R12.

		b5 Amplitude Mode (0: fixed, 1: envelope-variable)
		b4-b0 4-bit fixed amplitude level

Envelope Period Control (registers R13, R14)
	The frequency of the envelope is obtained by first counting down the
	input clock by 256, then by further counting down the result by the
	programmed 16-bit envelope period. This 16-bit value is obtained by
	combining the contents of the Envelope Coarse (R14) and Fine (R13) Tune
	registers.

Envelope Shape/Cycle Control (register R15)
	The envelope generator further counts down the envelope frequency by 16,
	producing a 16-state per cycle envelope pattern as defined by its 4-bit
	counter output. The particular shape and cycle pattern of any desired
	envelope is accomplished by controlling the count pattern (count up/
	count down) of the 4-bit counter and by defining a single-cycle or
	repeat-cycle pattern. This envelope shape/cycle control is contained in
	the lower 4 bits of register R15. Each of these 4 bits controls a 
	function in the envelope generator:

		b3 Continue
		b2 Attack	
		b1 Alternate
		b0 Hold
