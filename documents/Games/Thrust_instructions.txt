HOW TO PLAY
-----------
You can either:

- Play it on a real Vectrex using VecRam/VecFlash http://www.vectrex.biz/

or

- Play it on a PC using a emulator such as VecX or MESS.

MESS: http://www.mess.org
VecX (no sound): http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~manohv/vectrex.html

Emulators also need the Vectrex System BIOS.

Note: Vectrex Thrust does not seem to work well with the Dos Vectrex Emulator 'DVE'.



GAME INSTRUCTIONS
-----------------
The resistance is about to launch a major offensive against the Intergalactic
Empire. In preparation for this, they have captured several battle-grade starships,
but they lack the essential power sources for these formidable craft; Klystron
Pods.

You have been commissioned by the resistance to steal these pods from the
Empire's storage planets. Each planet is defended by a battery of "Limpet"
guns, powered by a nuclear power plant. By firing shots at the power plant,
the guns can be temporarily disabled; the more shots fired at the nuclear reactor,
the longer the guns will take to recharge. BUT BEWARE!! If you fire too many
shots at the reactor, it will become critical, giving you just ten seconds to clear
the planet before it is destroyed. If you have not already retrieved the pod
stored at that planet, then you will have failed the mission. If you have retrieved
the pod, and you manage to send the reactor into its critical phase, and leave
the planet safely, you will receive a hefty bonus.

Further into the Empire's system, you will encounter planets with REVERSE
GRAVITY and something even more deadly...


GAME CONTROLS
-------------
LEFT    = ROTATE SHIP ANTICLOCKWISE
RIGHT   = ROTATE SHIP CLOCKWISE
1       = LOCK THRUST (HARD+ mode only)
2       = ACTIVATE TRACTOR BEAMS/EXTERNAL SHIELDS

Note: The buttons are redefinable, press button 2 in title screen to make your
own settings.

To collect a Klystron Pod, hover just above the pod, activate the tractor beam,
and thrust away from the pod. When the automatic tow-bar has fixed to the
pod, you can deactivate the tractor beam.

To collect fuel, hover above a fuel cell, and activate the tractor beam.

A spare ship is allocated for every 10.000 points (20.000 in Hard+ mode).
The game will end if (a) You die and have no spare ships
                     (b) You run out of fuel

GAME MODES
----------
On the title screen you can start the game in different modes:

1. Normal
2. Hard+
3. Time attack

Normal mode is the mode most similar to the original Thrust-game.

Hard+ mode is harder, with a couple of extra features such as 
homing gun shots and extra levels. The 'lock thrust' feature allows
you to thrust in one direction while shooting in another.

Time attack is like normal mode, except you have a limit of 75 seconds 
to get the highest score.
