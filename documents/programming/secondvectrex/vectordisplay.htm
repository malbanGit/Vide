<p>Just let me drop a few words on how vectrex positions the beam
on the monitor. How the BIOS does it, and how one can use that
information to tickle a bit more speed out of the whole system. </p>

<p>I won't really go into the hardware level, if you want a good
description of a general way how a vector is drawn/positioned
look at the 'internal.txt' by Keith Wilkins. </p>

<p>There are a couple of highly important things to know in order
to understand the following. Look at the schematics, at the
'internal.txt' and at the reference sheet (or the documentation
of Vectrex Frogger) when I lose you. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>~ZERO (=VIA CA2)<br>
    ~BLANK (=VIA CB2)<br>
    ~RAMP (=VIA PB7)<br>
    VIA Timer 1 (One shot mode, PB7 enabled)<br>
    VIA Shift Register Mode 4 (Shift Out Under T2 Control)<br>
    VIA Interrupts<br>
    VIA Auxiliary Control Register<br>
    VIA Control Register<br>
    Integrators (look at 'internal.txt' good introduction!)<br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the above mentioned don't tell you anything, you are
probably better off learning a bit more an come back later :-)! </p>

<p>First I'll describe how the BIOS positions the beam, than how
it draws vectors and after that... well, let's see. </p>

<p>The BIOS upon initialization sets some VIA registers, if the
programmer does not change them, they will be relevant until you
switch your vectrex off. The BIOS most of the time assumes some
of the settings, if they should not be as expected your vectors
probably won't be drawn correctly anymore. </p>

<p>BIOS initializes the data direction registers of VIA port A
all for output and port B all for output except bit 5 and 6
(which are input). It than pokes $98 to VIA_aux_cntl. </p>

<p>There are mainly two aspects of interest in that setting,
first the shift mode, which is shift mode 4. Which means, that
shifting is enabled by poking something to the shift register,
and that the bit shifted out from bit 7 is circulated back to bit
0. Shifting continues even after 8 shifts. Shifting is done at
1/2 the system clock speed. The bit that is shifted out is put
into CB2 (~BLANK). ~BLANK is zero active, that means if the bit
is zero, output is switched off. The other interesting bit is the
one that enables PB7 output when timer1 is active. PB7 is the
~RAMP signal which is zero active, but becomes inverted. What it
comes to is that the integrators are switched on, when the bit
PB7 (= ~RAMP) is set. Integrators on means, that the vectorbeam
is moving. </p>

<p>Perhaps you can already at this point see where this is
leading us. The beam will be positioned for a certain time, the
time is stored to timer 1. While timer 1 is active the beam is
moving. Depending on the value in the Shift register, we have
this or that output. If there is %00000000 in the Shift register
we have no output at all, since at each shift a zero will be
stored to the ~BLANK line, which disables all output. If a
%10101010 would be stored to the Shift register we would see
something like a dotted line. Depending on the 'strength' of the
vectors we would see short 'dots' or wider 'dots'(!). If a
%11111111 was set we would see a solid line! </p>

<p>Following is some part of the BIOS Moveto_d function: </p>

<p>In D is the Y, X position, the first thing the function does
is send the Y strength to Port A of the VIA, which also is input
to the DAC. The DAC output can be distributed VIA a MUX to
different destinations since this is the Y coordinate we enable
the MUX with MUX settings which send the DAC data to the Y
integration data storage (the strength which will be added at
each cycle to the Y integrators, once additions are allowed), the
MUX settings which enable sending to Y is 00 (two bits of VIA
Port B). Enabling the MUX itself is also a bit of VIA Port B, bit
0, MUX is enabled by clearing that bit. Here a small description
of the bits of VIA port B:</p>

<p>Than the functions stores register D on stack, which also
serves as a short delay before disabling the MUX again. Right
after that we load register A with $CE, which as a bitmask is:</p>

<p>This sets the ~BLANK to low, which disables output and ~ZERO
to high, which disables zeroing. If zeroing is enabled, the
vector beam can not be moved, since it is 'grounded', it remains
in zero position. The settings thus allow the vector beam to be
moved. </p>

<p>Next we clear the Shift register, that means, when the
integration starts, the vector moves, there will be no output,
since at every shift out a zero will be moved to ~BLANK.
Integration will start as soon as ~RAMP is zero (which as said
before will be negated before reaching the integration circuit). </p>

<p>After that we disable the MUX, remember, the enable bit for
that was bit 0 of VIA port B. It gets disabled when the bit is
set. This means that the DAC value now only gets to the X
integration storage (which always gets the DAC value, the MUX
setting doesn't change that). </p>

<p>Than we store the X strength to VIA port A and thus to the DAC
register. The next step is to enable the timer by writing to the
hi byte. The high byte is cleared, since we integrate at most to
$ff time, which is the highest scale value. The scale value was
set before even calling the move function into the low byte of the
timer. </p>

<p>The next lines are IMHO not necessary, all this computing of
some extra cycles to wait. And actually I don't understand it.
Since the additional waiting is done AFTER the timer reaches
zero, that means the ~RAMP is disabled anyway, so no change to
any vector position will occur. </p>

<p>Anyway, let us assume that we reach the point marked ':HERE'.
Register B is loaded with $40, which is the bitmask for timer 1
interrupt testing. The loop's only purpose is to wait for the
time to expire. After the time has gone by the ~RAMP will be
again not active, no integration is done and position of the beam
will not change anymore (presumable), since ~RAMP is disabled, as
soon as the timer reaches zero. Why on earth the BIOS programmers
wait for some more cycles to go by - I don't understand. Apart
from that - you see that once you know where to put the correct
timers, and what registers are used for what... it is sort of
understandable how a vector is positioned. </p>

<p>The Vector drawing routines are essentially the same, apart
from the Shift register, which is not cleared, but set to $ff =
%11111111, which when shifted results in ~BLANK to be non active,
thus the beam is illuminated. </p>

<p>Here is a simple BIOS vector plot routine: </p>

<pre>Draw_Line_d     STA     &lt;VIA_port_a     ;Send Y to A/D
                CLR     &lt;VIA_port_b     ;Enable mux
                LEAX    2,X             ;Point to next coordinate pair
                NOP                     ;Wait a moment
                INC     &lt;VIA_port_b     ;Disable mux
                STB     &lt;VIA_port_a     ;Send X to A/D
                LDD     #$FF00          ;Shift reg=$FF (solid line), T1H=0
LF3ED:          STA     &lt;VIA_shift_reg  ;Put pattern in shift register
                STB     &lt;VIA_t1_cnt_hi  ;Set T1H (scale factor?)
                LDD     #$0040          ;B-reg = T1 interrupt bit
LF3F4:          BITB    &lt;VIA_int_flags  ;Wait for T1 to time out
                BEQ     LF3F4
                NOP                     ;Wait a moment more
                STA     &lt;VIA_shift_reg  ;Clear shift register (blank output)
                LDA     $C823           ;Decrement line count
                DECA
                BPL     Draw_VL_a       ;Go back for more points
                JMP     Check0Ref       ;Reset zero reference if necessary
</pre>

<p>That routine is part of some other routines, because of that
some things are done, which are not directly related to vector
drawing. The corresponding source lines do not interest us here.
As you can see the routine starts of exactly as the Moveto
routine, by setting the DAC to the Y strength. The MUX becomes
enabled, we wait a moment, than we disable the MUX again. This
time the routine assumes, that the ~ZERO flag is already set
correctly, so we don't bother with it. Then we poke the X
strength to the DAC. When integration starts we have the correct
strengths set to the integrators. Now we prepare the shift
register, we poke a $ff to it, which means we will be plotting a
solid line. Notice, that we are not integrating yet. But the
light is already switched on (so to say), since shifting starts
the moment we set a new shifting value. This is one of the
reasons, why all lines we draw have a bright spot at the
beginning. The light is always switched on a few cycles to early!
After that we clear the hi value of timer one, this enabled the
~RAMP, integration, now the vector beam is moving with the light
switched on, that means we are actually drawing a vector now.
This drawing will last till timer one expires. The movement will
cease the moment the timer reaches zero. Unfortunately the light
is not switched off automatically. We therefore wait in a loop,
till we get a message, that timer one has expired ($40 (bit 6) in
the VIA_int_flags register). After that we switch the light off
by clearing the shift register. Done, the complete line is drawn
now. As you can see there is no fiddling with any strange
additional wait loops, while drawing lines, but otherwise it is
exactly the same thing as positioning the vectors (apart from $ff
in the Shift register instead of $00). This sort of confirms my
suspicion, that these strange loops in the positioning functions
are sort of useless. In my experiments I have not seen any
differences, if I left them out.</p>
