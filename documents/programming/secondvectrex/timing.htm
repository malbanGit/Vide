<p>Vectrex uses a Motorola 68A09 microprocessor at 1.5Mhz. Thus
one cycle is 1/1,500,000 seconds. In order to to have a 50Hz
stable display (which is most desirable), we must do everything
we want within a limit of 30,000 cycles. The BIOS uses Timer 2 to
keep track of 'system time'. The Wait_Recal routine waits for
that timer to expire before continuing and recalibrating the
vector system. This BIOS timing information can be set at BIOS
RAM location Vec_Rfrsh ($C83D), which is a word pointer, $C83D is
the timer low byte, $C83E is the timer high byte. Thus a value of
the above 30,000=$7530 would be stored to the BIOS RAM location
with a sequence like: </p>

<p>LDD #$3075</p>

<p>STD Vec_Rfrsh</p>

<p>My experience: If you change the timer value, most of the time
the vectors will 'shake' a bit, especially if you don't zero the
beam frequently. The game speed will vary, and non moving vectors
(fixed, like a court or so) will annoyingly 'shake'! </p>

<p>The second (there are only two timers) timer (actually timer
1) is used for drawing vectors within BIOS vector drawing
routines. Actually while drawing vectors the timer is set with
the SCALE factor (which IS the low byte of the timer 1, a VIA
register, VIA_t1_cnt_lo ($D004)). Thus scaling DIRECTLY relates
to timing. Using a large scale factor always takes 'a lot' of
time. If at all possible use small scaling values. See also the
next Vectors-&gt;length! </p>
