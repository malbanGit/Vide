<p>From a Vectrex point of view: (internal.txt)</p>

<p>6522A<br>
</p>

<p>This device is used to control all of the vectrex peripheral
devices, such as the Keypads, Vector generator, DAC, Sound chip,
etc. </p>

<p>The A port is used as a BUS and goes directly to the DAC input
and sound chip input pins D0-D7. The DAC will output whatever
value is on this port.</p>

<pre>The B Port is used in the following way:</pre>

<pre>    PB0 - SWITCH    Switch Control, enables/disables the analog multiplexer,
                    see Vector drawing hardware description

    PB1 - SEL0      Controls multiplexer channel select, see section on
    PB2 - SEL1      Vector drawing.

    PB3 - BC1       Chip Select Signal for the AY-3-8192 Sound Chip
    PB4 - BDIR      Read/Write Signal for the AY-3-8192 Sound Chip

    PB5 - COMPARE   Feedback from the OP-AMP that does the comparison
                    for calculation of analog joystick positions.

    PB6 - ???       This line is fed to the cartridge connector. It is
                    likely that this line was to have been used as a ROM
                    bank select for cartridges greater than 32K.

    PB7 - ~RAMP     This line controls part of the vector drawing
                    hardware, see later. It is an active LOW signal.
</pre>

<p>The 6522PIA Has a number of control lines that are sometimes
used as handshake lines as the can generate interrupts, but on
the vectrex they are used to control the vector drawing hardware</p>

<pre>
    CA1 - IO7       This line is connected to the IO7 line of the AY-3-8192
                    sound chip. My guess it is used to generate an
                    interrupt to the CPU. See the AY-3-8192 description
                    for more details on IO7.

    CA2 - ~ZERO     Connected to the integrators that form part of the
                    vector drawing hardware. This line will cause them
                    to be zero'd (both X and Y) and has the effect of
                    bringing the beam back to the centre of the CRT. It
                    is an active LOW signal. See Vector hardware section
                    for more info.

    CB1 - Not Connected

    CB2 - ~BLANK    This Active LOW signal is the BEAM ON/OFF signal
                    to the Vector drawing hardware, and is used to hide
                    the beam when it is being positioned for re-draw.
                    See Vector hardware section for more info.
