<p>These routines are responsible for filling the music work
buffer while a sound is being made. It should be called once
during each refresh cycle. If you want to start a new sound, then
you must set $C856 to 0x01, and point the U-register to the sound
block. If no sound is in progress ($C856 = 0), then it returns
immediately (unless you called Init_Music or Init_Music_dft,
which do not make this check). When a sound is in progress, $C856
will be set to 0x80.</p>

<p>These routines process a single note at a time, and calculate
the amplitude and course/fine tuning values for the 3 sound
channels. The values calculated are stored in the music work
buffer, at $C83F-$C84C.</p>

<p>Music data format:</p>

<p>header word -&gt; $C84F 32 nibble ADSR table<br>
header word -&gt; $C851 8-byte &quot;twang&quot; table<br>
data bytes</p>

<p>The ADSR table is simply 32 nibbles (16 bytes) of amplitude
values.</p>

<p>The twang table is 8 signed bytes to modify the base frequency
of each note being played. Each channel has a different limit to
its twang table index (6-8) to keep them out of phase to each
other. </p>

<p>Music data bytes:</p>

<p>Bits 0-5 = frequency<br>
Bit 6 clear = tone<br>
Bit 6 set = noise<br>
Bit 7 set = next music data byte is for next channel<br>
Bit 7 clear, play note with duration in next music data byte:<br>
bits 0-5 = duration<br>
bit 6 = unused<br>
bit 7 set = end of music<br>
</p>

<p>ENTRY:</p>

<p>DP = $C8</p>

<p>U-reg points to the start of the music data</p>

<p>$C84D points to frequency table (Init_Music_dft only)</p>

<p>$C856 may need to be set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>EXIT:</p>

<p>D-reg, X-reg, Y-reg, U-reg trashed</p>
