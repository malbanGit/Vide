 *
 * --------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * How the assembler sequences the command line assembler
 * source files, include files, and macros is shown in a
 * simplified manner in the following.
 *
 *	main[asmain] sequences the command line files by creating
 *	a linked list of asmf structures, one for each file.
 *
 *	asmf structures:
 *	             -------------       -------------               -------------
 *                  | File 1      |     | File 2      |             | File N      |
 *	 ------     |       ------|     |       ------|             |       ------|      
 *	| asmp | -->|      | next | --> |      | next | --> ... --> |      | NULL |
 *	 ------      -------------       -------------               -------------
 *
 *	At the beginning of each assembler pass set asmc = asmp
 *	and process the files in sequence.
 *
 *	If the source file invokes the .include directive to process a
 *	file then a new asmf structure is prepended to the asmc structure
 *	currently being processed.  At the end of the include file the
 *	processing resumes at the point the asmc structure was interrupted.
 *	This is shown in the following:
 *
 *	             ------------- 
 *                  | Incl File 1 |
 *	            |       ------|
 *	            |      | next |
 *	             ------------- 
 *	                       |
 *	asmf structures:       |
 *	                       V
 *	             -------------       -------------               -------------
 *                  | File 1      |     | File 2      |             | File N      |
 *	 ------     |       ------|     |       ------|             |       ------|      
 *	| asmp | -->|      | next | --> |      | next | --> ... --> |      | NULL |
 *	 ------      -------------       -------------               -------------
 *
 *	At the .include point link the asmi structure to asmc
 *	and then set asmc = asmi (the include file asmf structure).
 *
 *	If a source file invokes a macro then a new asmf structure is
 *	prepended to the asmc structure currently being processed.  At the
 *	end of the macro the processing resumes at the point the asmc
 *	structure was interrupted.
 *	This is shown in the following:
 *
 *	             -------------       -------------
 *                  | Incl File 1 |     |    Macro    |
 *	            |       ------|     |       ------|
 *	            |      | next |     |      | next |
 *	             -------------       -------------
 *	                       |                   |
 *	asmf structures:       |                   |
 *	                       V                   V
 *	             -------------       -------------               -------------
 *                  | File 1      |     | File 2      |             | File N      |
 *	 ------     |       ------|     |       ------|             |       ------|      
 *	| asmp | -->|      | next | --> |      | next | --> ... --> |      | NULL |
 *	 ------      -------------       -------------               -------------
 *
 *	At the macro point link the asmq structure to asmc
 *	and then set asmc = asmq (the macro asmf structure).
 *
 *	Note that both include files and macros can be nested.
 *	Macros may be invoked within include files and include
 *	files can be invoked within macros.
 *
 *	Include files are opened, read, and closed on each pass
 *	of the assembler.
 *
 *	Macros are recreated during each pass of the assembler.
