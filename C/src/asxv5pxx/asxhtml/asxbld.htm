   The assemblers and linker have been successfully compiled for
Linux, DOS, and various flavors of Windows using the Linux  GCC,
the Cygwin environment, the DJGPP environment, and the graphical
user   interfaces   and    command    line    environments    of
MS Visual C++ V6.0,   MS Visual Studio 2005,   Open Watcom V1.7,
Symantec C/C++ V7.2, and Turbo C 3.0.  

   Makefiles  for  Linux,  Cygwin,  DJGPP,  project  files and a
makefile for Turbo C and psuedo makefiles and project files  for
VC6, VS2005, Open Watcom and Symantec are available to build all
the assemblers and the linker.  

   Unpack  the  asxv5pxx.zip  file into an appropriate directory
using the utility appropriate to your environment.  For  DOS  or
Windows  the following command line will unpack the distribution
zip file:  

        pkunzip -d asxv5pxx.zip


The  distribution  file  has  been  packed with DOS style end of
lines (CR/LF), and UPPER CASE file names.  The Linux  make  file
assumes  all  lower  case directories and file names.  For Linux
the unpacking utility you choose should have an option to  force
all  lower  case  directories / file names and convert the ascii
files to local format.  On most systems  the  following  command
should do the trick:  

        unzip -L -a asxv5pxx.zip

Some systems may require a -LL option to force all lower case.  

   The  distribution  will  be  unpacked into the base directory
'asxv5pxx' which will contain source directories for  each  sup-
ported  processor  (as6800, asz80, ...), the machine independent
source  (asxxsrc),  the  linker  source   (linksrc),   and   the
miscellaneous sources (asxxmisc).  Other directories include the
documentation (asxdoc), test file directory (asxtst),  html  do-
cumentation  (asxhtml),  NoICE  support  files  (noice), various
debug monitors that can be assembled with the ASxxxx  assemblers
(asmasm),  project files for an application that uses the AS6809
assembler and ASlink linker (project), and the packaging  direc-
tory (zipper).

   The  Symantec  product is no longer available but is included
for historical reasons (the final version, 7.5,  was  introduced
in  1996).   The  product had an excellent graphical user inter-
face, built in editor, project manager, and supported  DOS,  Ex-
tended  DOS  (the  executable  contained a built in DOS extender
which was rendered unusable in Windows 2000, after service  pack
2, or in Windows XP), Win95, and Windows NT.  


Graphical User Interface 


   Each  ASxxxx Assembler has a series of project specific files
(*.bro, *.def, *.dpd, *.lnk, *.mak, *.opn, and *.prj) located in
in  the  subdirectory \asxv5pxx\asxmak\symantec\build.  You must
enter the .prj filename into the Symantec IDE  and  then  select
Project->Settings->Directories  and  change the include, target,
and compiler output directories  to  match  your  configuration.
After  these  changes have been made you will be able to compile
the selected project.  These changes must  be  manually  entered
for each project.  


Command Line Interface 


   Before  the  command line interface can be used you must per-
form the steps outlined in the 'Graphical  User  Interface'  in-
structions above for each project you wish to build.  

   Open      a      command     prompt     window     in     the
\asxv5pxx\asxmak\symantec\build directory.   The  file  make.bat
found  in  the directory can be used to invoke the Symantec com-
mand line compiler.  The make.bat file assumes that the path  to
the  compiler  directories has been set in the environment vari-
able PATH.  Assuming the Symantec compiler has been installed in
the  default location (C:\SC) the file _setpath.bat will set the
PATH variable.  If this is not the case then the line 

PATH=C:\SC;C:\SC\BIN;C:\SC\INCLUDE;C:\SC\LIB

must  be changed to match your environment.  The compiled object
code      modules      will      be      placed      in      the
\asxv5pxx\asxmak\symantec\build  directory  and  the  executable
files will be placed in the \asxv5pxx\asxmak\symantec\exe direc-
tory.  


   The command 

        make all

will compile and link all the ASxxxx assemblers, the ASlink pro-
gram, and the utility programs asxscn and asxcnv.  The make file
can make a single program by invoking make with the specific as-
sembler, linker, or utility you wish to build:  

        make aslink


The  Symantec  make utility , smake.exe, uses the information in
the corresponding .mak files to compile and link the programs.  

   The file _makeall.bat found in the directory can also be used
to invoke the Symantec command line compiler.  The  _makeall.bat
file calls the _setpath.bat file to set the path to the compiler
directories in the environment variable PATH  and  then  invokes
'make all'.  

   The  command  file  _clean.bat may be used to remove all com-
piled .obj files and linked .exe executables.

   The  Borland  product  is  available in the Borland Turbo C++
Suite which contains C++ Builder 1.0, Turbo C++ 4.5 for  Windows
and  Turbo C++ 3.0 for DOS.  The DOS IDE will install and run on
any version of Windows (including Windows Vista [Longhorn]).  


Graphical User Interface 

   Each   ASxxxx   Assembler  has  two  project  specific  files
(*.dsk and *.prj)     located      in      the      subdirectory
\asxv5pxx\asxmak\turboc30\build.    You   must  enter  the  .prj
filename into the Turbo C++ IDE:  enter Options->Directories and
change  the  include and output directories to match your confi-
guration.  After these changes have been made you will  be  able
to compile the selected project.  These changes must be manually
entered for each project.  


Command Line Interface 

   Before  the  command line interface can be used you must per-
form the steps outlined in the 'Graphical  User  Interface'  in-
structions above for each project you wish to build.  

   Open      a      command     prompt     window     in     the
\asxv5pxx\asxmak\turboc30\build directory.  Assuming the Turbo C
compiler  has been installed in the default location (C:\TC) the
file _setpath.bat will set the PATH variable.  If  this  is  not
the case then the line 

PATH=C:\TC;C:\TC\BIN;C:\TC\INCLUDE

must  be changed to match your environment.  The compiled object
code      modules      will      be      placed      in      the
\asxv5pxx\asxmak\turboc30\build\  directory  and  the executable
files will be placed in the \asxv5pxx\asxmak\turboc30\exe direc-
tory.  


   The command 

        make all

will compile and link all the ASxxxx assemblers, the ASlink pro-
gram, and the utility programs asxscn and asxcnv.  The make file
can make a single program by invoking make with the specific as-
sembler, linker, or utility you wish to build:  

        make aslink


The Turbo C make utility uses the information in the correspond-
ing .prj and .dsk files to compile and link the programs.  

   The file _makeall.bat found in the directory can also be used
to invoke the Turbo C command line compiler.   The  _makeall.bat
file calls the _setpath.bat file to set the path to the compiler
directories in the environment variable PATH  and  then  invokes
'make all'.  

   The  command  file  _clean.bat may be used to remove all com-
piled .obj files and linked .exe executables.

Graphical User Interface 


   Each  ASxxxx Assembler has a VC6 project file (*.dsw) located
in a subdirectory of \asxv5pxx\asxmak\vc6\build.   Simply  enter
this project filename into the VC6 IDE and build/rebuild the as-
sembler.  


Command Line Interface 


   Open      a      command     prompt     window     in     the
\asxv5pxx\asxmak\vc6\build directory.  The file  make.bat  found
in the directory can be used to invoke the VC6 command line com-
piler.  The make.bat file assumes that the Visual  C++  compiler
has  been installed in the default location.  If this is not the
case then the line 

SET MS$DEV="C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\
               Common\MSDev98\Bin\msdev.exe"

must  be changed to match your environment.  The compiled object
code      modules      will      be      placed      in      the
\asxv5pxx\asxmak\vc6\build\as----\release directory and the exe-
cutable files will be  placed  in  the  \asxv5pxx\asxmak\vc6\exe
directory.  


   The command 

        make all

will compile and link all the ASxxxx assemblers, the ASlink pro-
