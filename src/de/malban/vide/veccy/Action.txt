Trigger (old)

Cause -> sprite collision, joystick, button, time (ticks)
Y,X -> sprite at a position, check variables

	protected Vector<Integer> mtriggerByY=new Vector<Integer>();
	protected Vector<Integer> mtriggerByX=new Vector<Integer>();
	protected Vector<String> mtriggerByTicks=new Vector<String>();
Ticks -> time expired tick
Target -> action to do when trigger is true

spriteID -> when col detect, than other sprite
            when not col detect, than a new sprite 


TODO

The current action must be divided in

a) Triggers (which can be AND combined) and consist of arbitraty count of triggers
   (OR combination may be implemented, but can also be just another action)
b) Results (which consists of 1..n possible results which take place if [triggers] = true

c) There can be trivial actions with 1 Trigger and 1 result, which are in principle the current implementation
