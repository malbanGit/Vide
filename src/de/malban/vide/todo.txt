Arrgh... not in the big window... though... sorry

DrawVLP with sequence not existent!

the big edit window in veccy
perhaps I can make it auto resizable...


Brett Wallach

I do see where to look now so that will help... it shows some text VECTOR / SET / POINT to the right of the tool icons in the main Vecci window.  So that helps, but would be better if it were duplicated to the large window.

I'm usually editing in the large window, and if I could just press V for "vector / selecting a vector", D for "points or dots", S for "set/drawing a vector", I could keep my left hand on the keyboard shortcuts and operate more easily I think.

When in the large window... if you could also press LEFT ARROW / RIGHT ARROW to cycle through the animation frames, that could be a cheap way to add a psuedo-onion-skinning.  If you can quickly switch between frames and not move your mouse, you could tweak points into the right position.




keep position (draw_vlp) in C does not work!

"C" - asm routinen must save U reg

If you change the BIOS to anything other than the FASTBOOT BIOS then Dissi does not show the correct 'Content' in the BIOS memory range. I see the correct behaviour for what is really at the memory locations but the 'Content' fields are incorrect.

Please can the 'Content' fields in the BIOS memory range be updated to reflect the actual content when a custom BIOS is used? Thanks!

I always wanted to provide a "C" bankswitch in Vide - but as of yet I always procrastinated - 
and really did not implement it yet... Anyway some workaround, which I also 
gave to Frank (Bloxorz).


"Fixed" adresses of functions in "C" programs.

This is not QUITE so easy, since the whole linker is written for relative positining. - but it is possible.

There is ONE sections, which alread has a fixed address ".cartrigde": 

Within that lies the defitions without which a vectrex program would not be able to start.
That section starts (and must start) at address 0.
In principle it is possible to extend that section, nonetheless the prerequisitions must be fixed, meaning:
- the header of both banskwitch pieces must be the same size
- the real header (as expected with a C standard program, Vide in "crartidge.c") lie must be compilation wise reside BEFORE
  the fixed code, otherwise the fixed code would start at 0, and not the cartrdige header code.

All functions, that are inserted into the section ".cartridge" will than be inserted AFTER the header.

ALSO!!!
Your first function in the header MUST jumpt to the expected programstart of your "C" program, otherwise
the "C" stub (which initializes e.g. the bss data) won't be executed.

All other functions in that cartridge section will than be fixed and for example in a bankswitched C program lie at exactly the same address.

This sounds more complicated than it really is
A demo "C" program, which compiles fine:

#include <vectrex.h>

 __attribute__((section(".cartridge"), used)) void _start()
{
    asm(" jmp s_.text");
}
 __attribute__((section(".cartridge"), used)) void doBankswitch(int b)
{
    int i=b+1;
    // do something that does bankswitching
    for (;i<10; i++)
    {
        Wait_Recal();
    }
}


int main(void)
{
    doBankswitch(1);
    while(1)
    {
        Wait_Recal();
        Print_Str_d(0, -70, "HELLO WORLD\x80");
    };
    
    // if return value is <= 0, then a warm reset will be performed,
    // otherwise a cold reset will be performed
    return 0;
}

a) gcc6809 hat mit -O2 Optimierung Code generiert, in dem zwei "clra" unmittelbar nacheinander vorkamen. 
    Das scheint das Ergebnis eines Optimierungspatterns zu sein. 
    Das zweite "clra" ist redundant und kann weggelassen werden, 
    das scheint aber in Nachhinein nicht bemerkt zu werden. 
    In meinem regexp Skript fange ich solche Dopplungen nun ab und behebe das. 
    Bemerkt Vide’s Peepholer so etwas?
 
b) Für Vectrex Zwecke ist es nicht notwendig, position-independent code zu generieren. 
    Mein regexp Skript ersetzt nun alle "lbra" durch "jmp", spart jedes Mal einen Zyklus. 
    Per Compiler-Option konnte ich den gcc6809 nicht dazu bewegen, die "lbra"s von selbst zu unterlassen. 
    Achtet Vide’s Peepholer auf so etwas?

Info Peer:
    Kurz: Das Format der „BIOS-Musik“ lässt ja in eingeschränktem Maße zu, dass man „mehrstimmige“ Melodien definieren kann 
        (Bit 7 gesetzt im Noten-Byte = next music data byte is for next channel). 
        Wenn Bit 7 niemals gesetzt ist, hat man eine „einstimmige“ Melodie. 
        Ich hatte bislang immer angenommen, dass in diesem Fall auch alle Noten hintereinanderweg auf 
        „demselben“ Kanal des Soundchips gespielt werden.

        Diese ist aber nicht der Fall. Die BIOS Sound-Routine spielt grundsätzlich immer alle Noten, 
        die sie bekommt, zyklisch hintereinander weg auf allen 3 Kanälen des Soundchips. 
        Also erste Note auf C0, zweite auf C1, dritte auf C2, vierte auf C0, fünfte auf C1, usw.

;	1) cursor positioning does not use the same system as most IDEs. Took me ages to get to grips with it, and it still feels off. Basically, if you click on
;		a character, the cursor appears at the start of that character (or tab) - however it should really look at the position within the character or tab
;		and go left or right of the character based on being above or below 50 percent of the way in. Hope that makes sense. May be very hard to fix.

;	2) Visual studio uses Alt with the mouse for block copying - so you can position a bunch of lines at once, or cut a square out of the text. Again - not
; 		vital but would be a great addition for anal coders like myself. 

;	8) I am a crap 6809 coder, and many people will be too - some other optimisations VIDE could suggest include 
;		clra clrb instead of ldd #0 - I think this uses less space?
;		lda and ldb with constants could show the ldd #$HEXX value you can use instead
;		cmpa #0 after a lda is unnecessary as the 0 flag is set after a lot (but not all?) operations - would be handy to have this pointed out by the compiler
;		overall however - I think vide's optimisation suggestions are great - very useful for tracking down efficient branches when files are being rearranged

Tricky things in Vectorblade

- only test 2 (player) shots per "round" 
- bonus rotation of "outer" shell is a seperate piece of "rotation"
- like in release all objects are held in linked lists and called via pulu d,pc (variables + behaviour)
- smartdraw is used as by Kristof Tuts, also called via stack "processing"
- > during object handling no subroutines are possible -> no stack left!
- at one /two locations I simulate a stack behaviour by "putting" a return address in an addition index register and "return" via a jmp ,y
- RAM locations are (depending on state of the game) used 2-3 times with different "roles"
- "events" within the object routines set flags that are handled outside the object routines (no jsr...)
- only one event of each type can happen per round (player was hit, enemy was hit, bonus collected, enemy spawn, etc) but that is still 50 times per second
- todo: poll joystick only "x" rounds and do "y" only each other round -> all in all saving of time
- also do animation stuff in object only every second round - so do something else only every second round
  (things that can alternate
   - animaiton
   - test to shoot
   - pattern update, destination check)

I also like idea b) as it is simple and elegant. It also should be rather easy to be achieved. Remember? We already did something very similar when we were working on the C setup: map several C variables/functions to distinct and/or the same memory locations by creating appropriate linker mapping files. Idea b) can easily be realized for C source code files, and thus it should also be easy for assembly language code, most likely even more easily than for C code. Cheers, Peer

        In dem Zusammenhang wäre es auch sehr gut, wenn ich externe Signale z.B. auf PB6

        Bin zur Zeit die Kommunikation mit einem PIC über PB6 am programmieren und das ist 
        ohne Simulation schon umständlich.

-       Oder könnte man vielleicht eine Java-Plugin Schnittstelle einbauen, was einfach pro 
        Takt eine Methode von einem Java-Programm von mir aufruft, die dann die Register vom 
        VIA zum lesen/schreiben zur Verfügung stellt? Das wäre wahrscheinlich die flexibelste 
        Lösung und dann kann ich mir das alles selbst programmieren, da Oszilloskop und 
        Signalinjektion ja doch schon recht speziell ist und wohl sehr wenig User brauchen würden. 
        Falls du den Sourcecode irgendwo hast, kann ich das Plugin-Interface auch schnell

Chris Romero If you have never removed the Vectrex's black Reset button it is fairly simple. The button is removed by unscrewing it in a counter-clockwise direction.

IF this is the FIRST time you have ever unscrewed the Vectrex reset button on a particular Vectrex some tips.
• Some Vectrex reset buttons are attached at the factory using a bit of thread lock on the reset button screw. These will be very tightly attached to the Vectrex reset switch.
• Take your time in unscrewing the reset button the first time. The slower the better. Otherwise the reset button head may become detached from the screw.
• Use something soft to grip and turn the reset button during removal. Fingers are best. But if this is not possible. then household adjustable pliers could be used AFTER wrapping the jaws in a couple of layers of the rubber or vinyl electrical tape. The tape will provide better grip and greatly decrease the possibility of marring / scratching / gouging of the button's plastic surface.

I have seen the result of where Vectrex have been subjected to people trying to pull off the reset button. In some cases the switch survived the assault. What was left was the switch's plastic actuator stem with a broken piece of the metal screw thread left inside the stem. That result shows how strong the stem is and how weak the original metal in the factory reset button screw can be. In other cases I can seen the switch stem body cracked. I would estimate those are units that had little to no thread lock material acting as a support for switch stem.

    Getting close...
    I found my very last Sega controller waiting to be butchered, took the cable out and soldered up the three leads that are n
    eeded for the 3d glasses. Three because we are not taking the 5V from the Vectrex, so only pins 3, 4 and 8 are needed.
    8 is ground, 3 is the signal from the Vectrex, and pin 4 is the signal going to the Vectrex.
    Please note! 
    That if you look at the Zack Ethridge document, he did not number the pins the same way the Vectrex schematics numbers 
    them, so he will be talking about pin 2 for the signal out instead of pin 4.
    One concern I had was to see if we need to add an extra resistor to the Arduino out pin but checked the Vectrex schematics 
    and there are 680 Ohm resistors on all the buttons so we are safe.

    DIS_TYPE_DATA_WORD_POINTER

Add to FAQ:
    I’m working on Windows 10 64-bit and VIDE 2.0 RC17. Monitor size is 27″, 2560 x1440, scaling 125%.

    The VIDE text and toolbar buttons have always been too small to be comfortable for me, the text sizes are 
    now changeable via LaF settings, but not the toolbar buttons. One problem seems to be that Java doesn’t recognise 
    the 125% scaling on what is quite a high DPI monitor, it sticks to 100%, whilst everything else is working at 125%.

    However, I discovered that you can tweak the high DPI settings to force Windows to adjust it to 125% from the 
    Windows Task Manager. Make sure VIDE is running and then press Ctrl+Shift+Esc to bring up Task Manager, 
    locate the “Java(TM) Platform SE Binary” application, right click on it and choose “Properties”, then on the 
    “Compatibility” tab, check the box labelled “Override high DPI scaling behaviour. Scaling performed 
    by:” and to get the 125% scaling, I choose “System” in the combobox. (The other two give me 100% scaling.) 
    Then, restart VIDE to run with the new settings.

    For me, choosing “System” gives 125% scaling. It’s a little blurry after that, but still quite usable and 
    easier to read for me.

        Debugging RAM
        --------------
        a) in dissi switch "nu" (no unkown) to not selected (GUI checkbox)
        b) better switch of "following" of dissi "df" (don't follow) (CLI command)
        c) switch on disassemble ram with "dr" disasm RAM (CLI command)

        Now RAM will be viewable in dissi.
        But usually all RAM is configured as Data - so no code will be displayed.
        While dissi is not tracking (camera is OFF) - best done also in pause mode,
        mark a RAM memory region and via popup menu cast to code.
        Perhaps you habe to "shift" memory regions, with "cast to byte" and "ungroup" also, to
        access the addresses that need to be cast to code.

        Disassembling RAM takes many resources, since the DISASM is done for each RAM - poke.
        If you do not need to disasm RAM, you better leave it switched off.

        Also note - disasm RAM might be usefull for bankswitch disasm.
        The cast to disasm is only done for the current active bank in dissi.
        Upon a bankswitch the casts have to be redone for the other bank!

 MAC problem wih keyboard
  Setting defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false makes it go away for me. Looks very like an OS related bug. – teppic Jan 9 at 6:33 
  see:

  Open the Terminal app and write:
  defaults write NSGlobalDomain ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false
  Then restart any open app in which you want this setting to activate.
  REVERTING BACK: Just,simply add true in place of false to the previous command like this:
  defaults write NSGlobalDomain ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool true

    Wenn ich das richtig sehe, kann man dort ADRS und TWANG einstellen und dann einzelne Noten anspielen und anhören. 
    Gibt es dort auch die Möglichkeit, eine komplette Melodie „im Original-BIOS-Format“ einfach abzuspielen?
    Ich nutze momentan die BIOS Soundroutinen, und ich bin musikalisch absolut unbegabt. Also trial & error. 
    Die Turnaround-Zeiten für das Ausprobieren kleiner Jingles erfordern immer ein C-Coding + Compile & Run und 
    sind somit relativ lange. Daher wäre so ein Feature sehr nützlich.
done:
    Ebenso nutze ich die BIOS Exlposion Routine. Ich bin damals auf keinerlei Doku hierzu gestoßen und habe dann 
    per reverse engineering den Code von Star Castle studiert, um die Funktionsweise herausgefunden. 
    Das war hart, aber durchaus spaßig. Auch hier wäre ein Ausprobier-Tool sehr hilfreich. 
    Ist aber nicht dringendes, nur so eine Idee.
Done:
    Bzgl. der Tabs ist mir Folgendes aufgefallen: Beim Editieren in Vedi liefert die Tab-Taste 
    „Sprünge“ von 4 Spaces, genauso wie in Geany. Nach dem Einlesen meiner (Geany) C-Files in 
    Vedi haben alle Tabs jedoch 8 Spaces. Der Code wird so recht „breit“ und läuft bei Mehrfachverschachtelung 
    schnell rechts raus und wird unlesbar. Wenn ich dann in Vedi weiter editiere und neuen Code hinzufüge, 
    werden (weiterhin) 4 Space Tabs generiert. Werden hier beim Einlesen/Unwandeln evtl. zu breite Tabs generiert?
done (but bad)
    Und wo wir schon dabei sind, hat der Editor evtl. auch einen auto-indent nach Zeilenumbruch 
    gemäß der Schachtelungstiefe der geschweiften {} Klammern (kennst Du sicherlich von anderen Editoren)?

    The label that is visible in the screenshot is not a macro label per se - since it is a global label.
    You should either end it with \? or declare it as local after the header of the macro.
    If you use THAT macro several times, the label "bstart" gets redefined every time the macro is used. Which might lead to erratic behaviour.
    Nonetheless - I check if something is wrong. I am not sure if the keyword local correctly identifies macro labels - now that you mention it.

Just googling - no - potrace can't. It seems a program called "autotrace" can -> 
http://autotrace.sourceforge.net/
You need a feature called "centerline tracing"...

https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/60107/convert-a-line-drawing-from-raster-to-vector-lines

autotrace -centerline -color-count 2 -output-file output.svg -output-format SVG input.png
    -line-threshold [real]:
    If a spline does not deviate from the straight line defined by its endpoints by more than the specified number of pixels, then treat it as a straight line (default: 1).

    - line-reversion-threshold [real]:
    If a spline is closer to a straight line than this, weighted by the square of the curve length, keep it a straight line even if it is a list with curves; default is .01.


The conversion is done using a programm called potrace.
Perhaps there are options in potrace that would work - never looked at it. Maybe you can tell potrace "treat bitmap as vector" - if I have spare time I might do some research on that...

WRONG:
    Don't use the original bios random routine ! It has a bug that might crash your game (it occured during my vector pilot development).

    Here is a patched version of the routine (bios labels are based on fred taft's disassembly):

    get_random_bugfixed:
    ;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
    ;+This function is a bugfixed version of the original bios get_random_a function.
    ;+
    ;+Inside the get_random_a and get_random_a2 routines of the vectrex BIOS.
    ;+A terrible bug is located: the X-pointer that needs to be pointing to
    ;+the random-seed in RAM is not loaded directly with the random-seed
    ;+address. Instead, it is loaded with the contents of the random-seed.
    ;+In some cases, this causes that new random-seed is written at random-places
    ;+in the memory map. Sometimes in a RAM-space, sometimes in a VIA-register.
    ;+This causes the program to crash !
    ;+
    ;+At entry: none
    ;+At exit : A = random-number.
    ;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
    pshs b,x ;backup b,x
    clrb ;seed of 0
    get_random_bugfixed_B_rounds:
    ldx #Random_Seed ;BUGFIX : set X-pointer to the ADDRESS-value of the random-seed !
    jmp ran_loop ;continue with remaining ROM-routine (see exec-rom)

NOT done (wont do):
  - LEX Macro syntax where a assembler instruction is concatinated from macros, like:
        ;Set the hi/lo part of a 16-bit register individually
        mCombine macro reg,hival,loval
        ld\1 #(lo hival)<<8 | (lo loval)
    endm
  - LEX same line, wont change lo hi, hi lo, which might be correct but shows as error
        these operators identify as variable, and two variables in a row are an error
        if syntax was not as flexible to allow lo Variable in stead of lo(variable) everything would
        be ok, but I rather be a little lax about the syntax!
  - LEX parenthesis: 
        lda (((2)+(1)) is no error, because at no stage arent enough closing brackets available...
  - ASM Might some day, not a priority- STRUCT Jup! :-( DEF.ASM (is that franks asm outpu???)
        Struct not done
  - LEX in OMEGA.as9  sprite_2           EQU sprite_1+#15       ;Start of structure for Sprite #2
        in the middle of nowhere a '#' should be wrong
        assembler accepts it, but IMHO that is not good, wont change!
  - DIS not done  - won't do ? or? if we are at it, also in between comments!
        (comments for lines which are grouped (in group) are not generated!)

http://mustcalculate.com/electronics/capacitorchargeanddischarge.php

VOLTAGES / capacitor

The general equation for the voltage across the capacitor is

    V=V0+1C∫idt

In the special case where I

is constant this translates to

    V=V0+I×tC

We want to find t

, so rearranging gives us

    t=C(V−V0)I=1F(3V−5V)−10mA=200s

    = 3 minutes and 20 seconds.

The more general solution is where I
is a function of time. I'll assume that the 10mA is the initial current, at V0 = 5V. Then the discharge resistor R=5V10mA=500Ω. The time constant RC

is then 500s. Then

    V=V0×e(−tRC)

or

    t=−RC×ln(VV0)=−500s×ln(3V5V)=255s

    = 4 minutes and 15 seconds.

This makes sense. Following an exponential discharge will get us at 3V later than with the linear discharge.
