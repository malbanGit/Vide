fixed hopefully - the vecci bug, where lists could be "shadow selected" and not accessed anymore

todo 
@Malban I haven't checked the Beta yet, but the main thing I would like to see fixed is that the last 
directory opened gets saved somewhere and Vide doesn't keep defaulting to the directory it's running in.  
This is mainly important for Vecxi and Vedi.  
A lot of times I'll want to test some binary in Vecxi, and it's not very easy to browse to a new location 
so I'll just copy files I want to try to the Vide main directory.  
Would be nice if it would just remember that I opened the ~/Downloads folder though, etc..  
Also when opening different projects I'm having to traverse through the tree, 
but that one is not as bad since the projects/ folder is right there and not many projects to look through.




todo
  build a function "memoryHarmonize" that ensures dissi mem == emulator mem
  a) must be called after changing memory in dissi 
  b) must be called after emulator (flash) changed memory in cart!

Fixed most of the tickets

I think for now this is "fixed".

It had to do with sample emulation, when a PSG was used to play 4bit
samples.
The recognition whether it was a sample or a standard PSG register
setting was not "broad" enough... and it
thus sometimes recognized the joystick reading as "sample output".

Vectorblade - remember diffivculty in SAVE


I've got a PiTrex - love it...well, except for the menu system - for some reason it doesn't always read joystick inputs, 
so I can sit there and have to flick the joystick left 5-10 times for it to move left. Joystick works great in game, 
just not in the PiTrex menu.

4bankswictth scheme added to template

bankswitchin in C



- veccy: fixed code export template directory generation

- YM: fixed a bug where the length of ym2! and ym3! files were not correctly calculated!



- C: WARNING - code like does not work - even though dp_VIA_port_b is declared as volatile, it is not read again!
            dp_VIA_port_b = 0x01;
            if ((dp_VIA_port_b & 0x40) == 0x40)
     Implementation of "volatile" is compiler dependend, to beon the save side explicit memory barriers should be set, like
            asm volatile ("" ::: "memory");                 // memory barrier
     before the if clause in above example!
- C: WARNING - Code MIGHT be build wrongly if the second parameter of a function is 8 bit and the first is 16 bit, example:
            -----
            extern void foo(unsigned long int x, unsigned int b);
            static unsigned int v;
            void bar(void)
            {
                            foo(v, 0);
            }
            -----
     This is a gcc bug, documented in: "https://gitlab.com/dfffffff/gcc6809/-/issues/6",
     also documented methods to circumvent (usage of compile parameters!)!
     For new C - projects the command line parameters "-fno-ipa-reference -ftree-ter" are added per default!
- C: linkage changed (Peer) - only library/calls which are needed are linked, removed option to use RUM INLINED
- C: new CRT0, which always has 48k support enabled
- C: assert functionality added (Peer)
     in "main" just add #inlude <assert.h>
     Per default asserts are active, do switch them off use either in code: "#define NDEBUG",
     or add the CCFLAG parameter (in project) "-D NDEBUG".
     Active asserts use precious cycles!
     If an asserts fires, a message with the assert parameters are output.
     On a button press the program continues (at your own risk)!
- misc: fixed download link for YM files (https now)
- vecxi: added mouse Analog -> coordinate input method (Graham)
  Note this is "hard" to get 1:1, either change the scale of drawing...
  Or "zoom" in using configuration "emulated vectrex integrator max" (smaller values)
- vedi: Add cmd A to editor (on OSX this has to be done manually for all field... I am certain I missed a few!)
- vedi: add cmd A/X/C/V to search
- vedi: all (in Vide added) tabs are now spaces
- dissi/vecxi: added "nmi"
- vecci: added hotkeys (standard) for delete (del) copy(meta c)/cut(meta x)/paste(meta v) undo(meta z)/redo(meta shift z) 
         selectAll (meta a) and mode switch (M)
         -> needs new config settings
         Win -> meta = CTRL
         Max -> meta = Command
- vecxi: added "super" save to debug when "SHIFT" is pressed during save (takes quiet some time, depending on the backstep configuration)
- all: added more debug info to startup and search of VIDE_HOME
- util: added some vecVefer conversion modes (8)
- test: for testing purposes added a vectrex color mode (Jason)
- vecci: added (text-)import filter for synced lists
- vecci: added import filter for Gyrock lists
- vecci: added template for smartlist with NO SHIFT REGISTER usage
- vedi: added "*.md" files to be editable
- vedi: pretty print asm    if then else elseif ifdef ...    Only 1 space "insert"
- vecxi: added "fauly" VIA mode
- vedi: if resulting binray is too large - hit prints the size!
- vecxi: added a faulty vectrex mode
- vecxi: T1 timer one shot mode, now resets the timer to the latch times
         "read" of VIA is always after the complete "cycle" run.
-vecxi: Changes done in Vide for 100% cycle exact execution of VB
        (it still is not 100%!)
        - T1 timer one shot, was not "reset" with latch values after reaching 0, including one cycle "duration" of reset
          reloaded value is shown "false" in vecxi since it shows "value+"
          the real VIA shows hi ff, lo 0 and than the "real" value appears next round - >there is a delay of one cycle!
        - t2 needa one cycle to START the actual timer, befor it counts down
        - values read with "lda" kind of instructions are read AFTER all instruction cycles are processed (however strange that may be)
        - STB direct, value is written after 3 of 4 cycles  (STA after 4 !?!?!?)
        Falsly shown in Vide:
        - State of CB1 (also interrupt flag CB1), vectrex has NO CB1
        - half carry is "uncertain" emulated
- dissi: load in dissi different configured disassemblings
- vedi: file not found exception when trying to edit file properties
- dissi: UNOWN data types were possible in dissi (not disassembled)
- dissi: strings could be "closed" with any negative value (instead of only 0x80) - during a string scan!
- vedi: include in subdirectories were not parsed correctly (sometimes)
- vecci: corrected VBSmartlist generation 
- vecxi: analog joystcik  vertical in relative mode had wrong directions
- vecxi: better reconnect to joysticks that time out
- vedi: lower upper character independency added in label jumping
- ym/vedi: ym menu was not enabled correctly
- vecxi: soft reset no does not delete/initialize RAM
- vecx: joystick buttons must only be set, when PSG regs are in output mode

3rd of April 2019
Version 2.51
bugs:
- smartlist creation was buggy
- added QI variants of div/mod to C compiler library

20th of March 2019
Version 2.50
new:
- vecci added settings to scale x,y,z seperately
- vecci: added centerline tracing via external tool "autotrace"
- vecci: load lists to VecFever directly
- new SmartList creation (can also still switch to old)
- tool: added tool to "build" Video movies from "extreme vectrex" fata files. The builds can be played on a vecFever
- tool: to build "Wav" player for vecFever
- WR: now also uses bank bank information
- reverted Vedi back to Java 1.8 and distributed now as "native packaging"
- added additional stack tracking
  stack is shown in Vari: 
  - current stack: blue background
  - current WR low: pink background
  - all time low stack: red background (is reset with tracki reset)
- added breakpoint for stack, 
  e.g. > B stack $c9a2
  means break when register S contains a value lower equal to $c9a2
- for "C": the highest used memory address is evaluated (via MAP file)
  and put into the generated CNT file with e.g.
  "HIGHEST_USED_RAM $C9A2"
  (only when debugging is enabled)
  Than dissi will also generate automatically a breakpoint of the above kind for that address, 
  -> a stack overflow check!
  Also a comment is added to the RAM address like:
  "COMMENT $C9A2 not used RAM onword..." - so that you can discern that address easily in VARI

bugs:
- tinylaf and Java 10 seem to have problems when iconifying the window. Iconify disabled (and removed again by switching back to Java 1.8)
- C debugging was not working, when a function parameter had a pointer to a struct -> hopefully corrected
- corrected Pattern draw from vecci (mode)
- changed all modal dialogs in Vide from "desktop internal modal" to "system modal" since the previous implementation caused problems
  (Freezes) on some machines (Java 10 problem -> but System modal was not set to desktop internal modal again.
- found a vectrex which has a T1 offset of 2 cycles -> all smartlist maximum scale without additional NOPS changed from 9 -> 7 :-(
- some bugfixes for "C" debugging
- exchanged all "C" compilers with builds made from the git repository at: https://gitlab.com/dfffffff/gcc6809
  which has some changes/bugfixes
  "internal" sources changed a bit but the user "should" not notice anything different.
  If one uses extended ASM commands from "C", some constraint my throw a depricated warning.
  In some example case Peer did, he had to change a constraint from "mi" to "gmi".
  All gcc compilers are now static builds (Win also), Windows gcc differentiates now also between 32bit and 64bit.
  Compile instructions and sources for gcc are included for all supported OS
- corrected many sources to be compilable under Linux (small and capital letters in filenames)
- if the lexer for syntax scanning encounters an exception, the syntax scanning is no longer exited with an exception
  (and the whole document "srcewed", instead the lexer "ignores" one byte, and generates an ERROR token, so the rest of the
  document is further correctly scanned.

-----------------
27th of December 2018
Version 2.11
new:
 - vecx: on/off switch of Goggle/Lightpen in config
 - vecx: added anaglyphic mode to imager


24th of November 2018
-----------------
Version 2.1

- added digital input device support for vecxi
- vecci: added "int all" checkbox
  ("normally" all vectors in vecci are internally kept as "double", if you scale a vectorlist, than beforehand "ints" can have non int values
  you can see that be double clicking in the table and examining the value via the tableeditor. For some calculations it better to have PURE int values
  if the swtch is "ON", than all values are always rounded and "ints")
  
- vecxi: std, stx, stu, sty were for the second part of the written byte written, one cycle to fast - corrected
- assi: ds can now have a default filler value
- vecxi: preliminary support of flash (SST39SF020A) introduced (vedi project only, no "saving", address and data BUS is very "hacky",)
  since the emulation does not support a ~CE flag, and I do not really emulate a BUS, all "emulation" is handled in "cartridge" directly)
  - supported: erase sector, get ID ($bf $b6), write byte (when used with "st..."
  - only in debugging core!
  - not supported is the "saving" of those changes to the binary though
- dissi: breakpoints can be disabled, enabled, saved and loaded (in breaki)
- vecci: smartlist support now "multiple ..._d"
- vecxi: preliminary support of new bankswithcing PB6 combined with IRQ 
  this can handle 4 banks each 48kb. = 192kB
- vecci: added move to popup menu
- vecci: added "move" and "solid" buttons
- Sample: added option to save samples as unsigned data
- Sample: added option for 4bit sample output (2 nibbles)
- Sample: added two options and disabled them, because I now think they are not sensible...
- Sample: added generator for PSG samples (automatic PSG samples are assumed if 4bit samples are chosen)
- vecxi: PSG samples can be played by the emulator, 
         quick hack to support samples played via PSG, this is not good! (only working in special siuations, and not really using the PSG)
- vecxi: saved states are ADDITIONALLY saved with a timestap, to load a timestamped savestate - remove the timestamp
- vide: added java version check on startup, at least 10 is required!

BugFix:
- break points in files with two banks (switched via if then else) did generate a false breakpoint in the "other" bank -> fixed
- in vecci vectorlists in the file choser are now visible also for "just" vectorlists
- scenario "preview" in play panel working correctly (again)
- search and replace could "destroy" performace (dunno - some inner Java garbage), anyway - might be a little bit better
- the "running cycle count" was not always updated with the correct cycle count of the instructions -> fixed
- C-library added a couple of "Minestorm" functions


12th of June 2018
-----------------
Version 2.02
new:
- added scenario generation for smartlists

BugFix:
- copy/paste error with 2.01 - Smart list generation did not work with "runnables"
- also due to some stupidity lost some code - whatever that was that I fixed
- small bug fix with paths garbled in codelib



24th of May 2018
----------------
Version 2.01
new:
- changed the scaling done in vecci

BugFix:
- added some Java 10 compatabilities

18th of May 2018
----------------
Version 2.0
new:
- integrator offset can be fractions, which are as of yet dumbly calculated - but works (more or less) for vector Patrol
  todo -> RC/laws, setting of integrator offsets to fractions of "digital 1"  thru the use of RC laws
  to compensate vector drift is fascinating, and bloody ingenious!
- Integrator zero ofset realized with capacitor charge calculation. (at one point I have to also do that for 
  s/h of integrators, integrators themselves and for zeroing)
- RAM comments go to all banks
- RAM breakpoints do not have banks
- dissi table updates could be out of whack when to many Bankswitches occured (stuck)
- internal t1 Ramp signal is also switched off, when interrupt does not occur, corrected
  Vector Patrol Print String all but the first line were "off" a bit due to that (also background mountains)
- T1 reset upon timer t1 LoLatch read IFlags must be reset
- added emulation of AT24C02
- added loading of non encrypted V4E files (File format invented by Thomas Sontaowski for VecFever)
- with this also added 32k + 16K Bankswitch 
- added smartlist vectorlist and animlist generation, also added output and runnables to Vecci
- added warning dialog when a binary file is selected for load in vecxi and a cartridge definition is found for that name
- some documentation updates

BugFix:
- typo in C lib fixed (thanks to Peer)
- code library could throw exceptions while syntax highlighting
- bank switch code must consider output bit of pb6 - not only state of ddrb
- corrected vecflash bankswitching code (also template)
- (saved) Master sound volume is now recognized on startup (without having to open config once)
- Ramp Off fraction corrected - could be initialized to early and display would be slightly off
- corrected some cycle values of machine code instructions, also some more cycle exact emulation
- corrected some tooltips
- switching from fullscreen to windowed mode in Windows could throw an exception which led to no
  vide screen at all -> fixed
- finishing a compile while vecxi was in fullscreen could lead to an exception -> fixed
- configuration window now properly named configuration (before: Registers)

January 9th 2018
----------------
new:
Version 2.0_RC17
- vedi: added a new peep
- vecxi: added Blank Off timer
- doc: documentation added on handling assembler calls from "C"

BugFix:
- laf: html color settings for LAFs werenot correctly handled -> fixed
- compile: error messages of ASLINK and AS6809 were not always correctly handled -> fixed
- sources: some soucres had wrong upper/lower cases in filenames, only noticable under linux
- vedi: new projects resulted in null pointer exception

December 29th 2017
------------------
new:
Version 2.0_RC16
- added "no framepointer needed" version of Peer's system headers

BugFix:

December 29th 2017
------------------
new:
Version 2.0_RC15
- vedi: added an additional configuration for deep syntax check (in conficguration).
      with large files (larger than e.g. 100000 bytes, some syntax check need more time, since the
      complete document is scanned. If handling large files makes the editor chunky 
      this part of syntax checking highlighting can now be switched off.
      Also added a "Threshold" - so the above can be configured "ON" but for file sizes larger than xxxxxx
      the deep syntax is automatically "OFF"
- dissi: DW_POINTER added in popup in dissi (was avilable in CNT always - but never manually configurable
- diffi: profiling, added ability to "update" dissi window, without the table following current PC (new CLI command DoNotFollow - "df")
- help: added an ascii table (e.g. type ascii in editor help textbox, or dissi cli)
- dissi: profiling enhanced, that the dissi column display, also displayes the sums of subroutine executions
- display: added import of chassis png from ParaJVE in config - images are not used yet.
         Franck: I didn't violate any copyright, to spare you the search look at de.malban.util.extractor package.
         (PS. I made contact with Franck and he is ok with reuse!)
- cartridge: some config options can be overwritten by the cartridge information, the config stays overwritten till
       next cartridge with "overwrite" is loaded, or config is reloaded/changed
- display: added full JOGL (OpenGL support), since it was so much work - I'll list the different steps:
  - rendering of lines, points and linestrips (last - splines)
  - respecting movement speed, brightness and dotdwell
  - blur/glow/spill shaders for more nice output
  - linewidth, persitency and brightness can be adjusted (like everything on the fly)
  - drawing done using openGL drawArray for speed (not "simple" line point commands)
  - anitaliazing with/without MSAA supported
  - overlays supported
  - overlays can be "configured" to look nicer via special shader settings
    a) alpha threshold
    b) alpha "dim" if no vectors are drawn (direct adjustment of alpha values)
    c) alpha "brighter" if vectors are drawn (adjustment via brightness factor of lines)
  - 3d imager rendering supported
  - lightpen supported
  - debug outputs (messsages, vectors as arrows, integration position)
  - LED (display)
  - rotation
  - raygun
  - idea copied from ParaJVE, a "screen"-display can be added, and adjusted to ones likings
- display: (JOGL only) screen "overflow" emulation now supported, e.g. frog demo "EmptyScreentro"
- display: (JOGL only) added config to keep aspect ratio of emulator output
- display: (JOGL only) added option to output emulator on complete window [in vecxi press SHIFT P to toggle]
- display: (JOGL only) added option for fullscreen output (also rotated) [in vecxi press SHIFT F to toggle]
- vecx: added a new vecx mode "no debug", than every debug "calling" are right from the start disabled.
        This gives another speed increase. The mode is intended, when Vide is used as an emulator only.
- Vide: support that Vide can be started from "any" directory, not from only the directory Vide resides in.
        This was more complicated than it sounds, since ALL file accesses had to be changed. I am not sure that
        I have got them all, there might be some errors with file accesses - please report if so. 
        This was extensivly tested, but more than 100 classes had to be edited... - and humans make mistakes and 
        overlook things!
- support: added under utilities a new Window "Overlay Switcher", with that you can switch overlays easily on the fly
           with currently running vecxi, without having the trouble to go to some configuration hassle each time.
           (its not persistent though)
- display: enhanced Catmul Rom Splines to be able to correctly draw Thomas new game (2048)
- dissi: loading a saved state while in pause/debug mode - pauses/debugs the load directly after load
- all: implemented a new default "LAF", some internal changes were necessary so that all necessary changes could be made,
       to many to list here
- vide: added a "message" of the day
- vide: command line options started, following parameter working:
        -help             -h        help
        -configuration    -co (=)   name of the configuration file to load (e.g. developer.vsv)
        -jogl             -jg (+/-) start with jogl graphics enabled
        -oldJava          -oj (+/-) start with java graphics enabled
        -keepAspectRatio  -ar (+/-) keep aspect ratio when size of vecxi changes
        -exitAfterGame    -ex (+/-) shuts down vedi after exiting vecxi
        -fullpanel        -fp (+/-) starts vecxi in fullpanel (only if vecxi runs)
        -fullscreen       -fs (+/-) starts vecxi in fullscreen (only if vecxi runs)
        -enableOverlay    -eo (+/-) whether to load an overlay, if available
        -enableScreen     -es (+/-) whether to enable the 'screen' drawing
        -port0Device      -p0 (=)   name of the configured input device (names as they appear in vecxi combobox)
        -port1Device      -p1 (=)   name of the configured input device (names as they appear in vecxi combobox)
        -rotation         -ro (=)   rotation (0, 90, 180, 270)
        -binary           -bi (=)   loads a binary file and starts vecxi
        -gameCartridge    -gc (=)   loads a cartridge definition and starts vecxi (name of the cart)
        -resolution       -rs (=)   resolution of fullscreen, format like 800x600
- dissi: added a small stack "view" in reg display (dissi only)
- vedi: tree refresh now keeps the tree opened
- vedi: added "mini" pretty print for C, also added autoindent for curly braces (1tab per brace)
- config: saving a "no name" config - automatically now saves to "default"
- vedi: double click on a file entry starts the OS default viewer (double click on a bin starts vecxi)
- vedi: CTRL + Space gives a list of known vars/functions to chose
- dissi: disassemble to code on an unkown binary, when PC "steps" to "data". This circumvents the need to do tedious "casts".
         Only works, when "stepping" into the region, not when scrolling thru dissi (Thomas knows what I mean :-) ).
- added binaries of Garry Grierson and Thomas' 2048 (for both I got permissions of the authors)
- sound: added (in instrument editor) the opportunity to enter "songs" in vectrex format and play them back 
- sound: new tool "Explosion editor" allows with a gui to edit explosion effects based on the explosion function provided by the BIOS
- dissi: added (well hidden - see FAQ) the ability to also disasm RAM locations - for now this is a "Hack"
- all: added support for 48k ROMs (must be configured for cartridge!)
- C: CFLAGS can also be set via File properties
- vedi: peepholes of Vide can be loaded and saved to "VidePeepholes.xml", if no file exists defaults are generated and saved,
        as of yet there is no editor though. If you want to create your own peepholes look at directory "peeper" at the sources.
- vedi: peepholes can (at least) be switched on and off seperately (project dialog)
- config: added configuration section for peepholes
- vedi: hopefully improved syntax check of copy/pasted/deleted varnames
- vedi: C-breakpoints improved a little
- vedi: new definitions of RAM/ROM/IO of Peer included now (enables direct page, and better "variable" usage (not indexed registers in -O0) )
- vedi: hopefully slightly correcter {}
- vedi: syntax highlite Var/Function definition is not "GLOBAL" but Vedi based. That means you can have independened Vedi instances open, without
        their Var/function definitions interfere with each other (very good vor copy and paste :-) )
- vedi: projects are now "independened" of their "home" directory, meaning - projects take the directory they  are loaded 
        from as their home, no need to place them in exactly the same "vide - relative" position anymore.
        Thus - projects can be much more easily be "transported" to other locations (computers) 
- tracky: add "peek" counter in Tracky

BugFix:
- vecx: vector (drawings) get better updates when debugging
- vedi: syntax check for macros had a bug, where a macro definition ending with the word "macro" was not recognized as such
- cartridge: bug in cartridge config, where filesnames of instructions and critics might have been created wrong
- overlay: rotation of overlay was not handled correctly
- dissi: reinitializing after a dissi "destroy" now switches to the correct bank at startup
- vecx: vecx bug fixed, TFR of register "A" (read) resulted ALWAYS in $ff -> fixed
- vecx: vecx bug fixed, read word value was implemented with "(datahi << 8) | datalo" which
        resulted in wrong values - correct it must be: (datahi << 8) | (datalo&0xff)
- vecci: should export Draw_VLP with 0 pattern -> fixed
- vedi: should start on vecFever, even if emulation is not started -> fixed
- vedi: somewhere along the way breakpoints in enriched files were broken... corrected
- vecx: BUG: load vecVox switches to vec Voice
- vedi: BUG: fcw is red as syntax


July 1st 2017
-------------
Version 1.20
new: 
- vecxi: reSid emulation included - now properly included in the
         cartridge emulation. Registers visible on "carti", saving, loading and stepping forward
         and backwards now work.
         Setting in Configuration removed - it is now a cartridge option
- xml: xml subsystem changed, so tags are case sensitive. This is an immense speedup, since now
       I can use StringBuilder class to handle xml, not Strings anymore. Stringbuilder has no build in 
       toUpper() that can be used to search/replace
- vecci: internally vectorlists can now be given a "BLOW_UP" string. For the storyboard, giving this as a
       parameter instead of replacing it afterwards is also an immense speedup
- vecci: the storyboard sync generation has a "noAdditionalOptimization" switch.
       If set, vecci upon creation of sync lists does not try to optimize further (which also uses quite some time
       if large vectorlists). If the animation is optimized beforehand (new optimization buttons, which SHOULD be used)
       this will not enhance anything, instead will cost time while generating only)
- dissi: settings for VecFever for "TF" now in configuration - no need to have a Vedi window open all the time.
- vecci: started version II of storyboard, might be easier to handle.
- vecci: colors for vectordisplay are now configurable (in configuration->Miscellaneous)
- vedi: added configuration options for the pretty print columns (in configuration->Assembler)
- dissi: added first steps towards "profiling" (new dissi button)
       switched on in configuration, must be switched on BEFORE vectrex program is started,
       profiling data is not saved/loaded/influenced by load/save or stepping backwards and forwards while debugging,
       if tracker is open and active one can also watch profiling data for one vectrex round (instead of complete runtime)
       One can see how often subprograms are executed, and how much time (cycles) they need.
       No drill down yet, not instruction based yet!
- dissi: added executed cycles and instruction count into dissi table (when profiling is enabled)
- vecx: mouse can be configured as analog input (relative movement translated to horizontal/vertical analog)
- vecx: added first steps to emulating "X, Y integrator offset values"
- starter: slightly changed download configuration
- starter: added quite a few TOSEC binaries (+ download)
- starter: added many images and texts
           starter contains by now about 190 "directly" executable vectrex binaries 
           (the majority of homebrews/schoolbrews are downloaded by starting the first time)
- codi: I got the sources for Becky's message and Koko's retribution from Dan Siewers with the permission to 
        include them with Vide -> can be found in the codelib!
- config: new config item whether images should be loaded for starter table (takes quite some time) - default is OFF
        can be changed under tab miscellaneous. Changes only respected with next opened starter window 
- cartinfo: bug where text "edits" were not saved to textfile (instruction and critics)
- vecxi: played around again with open GL - JOGL this time
         seems to work much "easier" than LWJGL, it can be "preliminary" switched on in configuration (miscellaneous) [for next vecxi instance].
         But output as of yet is absolutely PLAIN - no overlays, colors, brightness, antialiazing, curves etc...
- vecxi: original bug in emulation code discovered - upon read of T2 low counter the iFlag must be resetted - that was falsly implemented
         and could lead to vectrex games crashing (e.g. omega chase).
- vecxi: added as config item for efficiency also an efficiency "threshold"
         I define efficiency as the "efficiency" with that the integrators work. The higher the sum of the integrators, the less "efficient" the
         integration works.
         e.g. x integrator is 0, adding 100 results in the integrator being 100
              x integrator is 20000, adding 100 results in the integrator being 20090
         Efficiency threshold calculates in laymans terms "at what" integration value the "degrading" of the
         summarizing kicks in. Default values roughly like my own vectrex (it usually kicks in wayout of the visibity range)
- documentation update
 
BugFix:
- vecci: storyboard animations could not be loaded if saved on another platform - due to file seperator settings
- vecci: bug with rotation, did rotate always twice the given angle!
- vecci: in new shortcuts, there could be paths connected with moves > 127 -> garbled output!
- source: in the file "VECTREX.I" the definition of "Rot_VL_Mode" was wrong!
          if that was used, than a crash of your program would occur!
- util: minor flaw in reading xml text corrected (leading and trailing spaces)
- vecvoice: Slight change in vecVoice emulation code. Pythagorean triangle was not running ok,
        the "buffer full" test is different than in my alex herberts code.
        This was "fixed" with a "hack"
        

31st of May 2017
----------------
Version 1.19
new: 
- vecxi: reSid emulation included - sound still has some crackling noise though
         expects a sid-"card" inserted, registers from $8000 - $8020 
         (enabled in config - miscellaneous)

BugFix:

30th of May 2017
----------------
Version 1.18
new: 
- documentation update
- vecci: again speedup of optimizations in vecci
- vecci: also the size optimization now respects the resync
- vecxi: started adding reSID - although this is as yet not tested and can not be used!
- vecx: efficiency emulation slightly changed

BugFix:
- small bug/syntax/entity placing corrections

29th of May 2017
----------------
Version 1.17
new: 
- vecci: added wavefront obj export
- vecci: "optimization" buttons from 1.16 quite a bit more performant
- documentation for all that is still pending...

BugFix:

28th of May 2017
----------------
Version 1.16
new: 
- vecci: added popup menu to delete vectors from the table
- vecci: storyboard added - probably Isidro will be the only one to ever use it :-) 
- vecci: corrected "remove dots" to 3d
- vecci: added diverse "optimization" shortcauts (new tab shortcut 2)
- vecci: added option to rotate selected vectors (in mode vector only)
- documentation for all that is pending...

BugFix:
- vecci: Bug with grid/no grid. If no grid was selected new points were set at +100000
- vecci: closing the 3d-extra window also reseted the 2d-extra window (vice versa) 
- vecci: draw sync list now respects splitter settings
- vecci: draw sync now works correctly with "BLOW UP"
- vecci: some other bugfixes I can't remember

9th of May 2017
---------------
Version 1.15 - codename Isidro
new: 
- vecci: 3d view/editor of vectorlists (as seperate window) - accessible thru new "window" button besides the main edit 
         * you can not add vectors, only move and work with vectors
         * CTRL mouse moves the viewport
         * scaling is possible
         * sliders for all 3 axis (independend of other views)
         * checkboxes for "grid" for each axis 
         * checkbox for "move allowed" for each axis 
         * axis can be shown or hidden (independend of other views)
         * byte "cube" (frame) can be shown/hidden
- vecci: added option to not connect more than 2 vectors at one time

BugFix:
- morphing routines had a small bug, where after finished morphing sometimes the pattern of the resulting
  vectorlists were not correctly set

3rd of Mai 2017
---------------
Version 1.14
new: 
 - vecxi: finally added configuration to size the ringbuffer, user can give ANY (up to 50000) size, may result in OOM exception though,
          user must know self how much memory he has available
 - dissi: step forward and backward can step multiple times, + SHIFT 10 steps, + CTRL 100 steps  
 - dissi: the enabling of ROM + PC breakpoints can be "ON" per default now (configuration setting)
 - dissi, vecxi: added FRAME undo - step back 30000 instructions (every 30000 instructions a frame is saved, up to buffer size)
          that way larger step backs are possible without MB collections of data
 - config: moved sound configuration to miscellaneous instead of emulation
 - ay: added new PSG emulation core: libayemu
 - ay: added the option to chose between two PSG emulation cores, the "old" one (of MAME), and LibAYEmu
 - vide: added on tree popup: "add new empty file" 
 - aks: added to vide (in vedi) the ability to add and play back on vectrex Arkos Tracker files,
        in vedi right click on the tree menu and select a Arkos Tracker "bin" song. And generate 
        example source code.
 - vedi: added to the vedi label selection, the macro definitions 
 - vecci: Using CTRL mouse drag on a vector display window - DRAGS the viewport, much more "unsable" than the arrow buttons
 - vari: added checkbox to switch of display of BIOS variable names
 - vari: added checkbox to see ALL RAM locations (not only the "named" ones)
 - dissi: double click on the "operand" column opens vari and places the selection in the correct row (if operand denotes a variable)
 - dissi: added command line command to "dump" (development mode -> RAM disk) the current active ROM to FecVever
          to get the correct VecFever settings a vedi window must be open, where the settings are correctly set
 - help: updated
 - vecci: added the ability to select +/- to the rotation (clockwise/anticlockwise)
 - vecci: added a "extended" switch for sync draw lists. The extended version also respects intensities

BugFix:
- assi: include filenames did not correctly exchanged seperators accross different platforms
- assi: an original bug fixed, std #address, generated a not possible mnemonic (without error or warning)
- vedi: another one of those small syntax highlighting changes ("lost" vars might be refound)
- vedi: include files in a subdirectory which included files in a subdirectory could not be
        double clicked and opened - and a thread was spawned, that could not be shut down - corrected
- ym: the ym recording now "sees" if register 13 was retriggered - and sets the value correctly - even it
      is the same value as befor.
- ym: streamed ym player sometimes did not set channel 7 correctly - corrected
- vedi: assembling and executing single files (not objects) did sometimes not work (internal null pointer exception - not reported) - corrected
- vedi: labels inside macros are now ALL macro labels, not only labels that end with \?
- vecci: some corrections and beautifying to the User import/export dialogs, the syntax highliting could go astray and
         the loadings and saving were "disturbing"
- vecxi: multistep is finaly functioning like intended (not thread blocking after a few steps)
- vecci: another small bug with grid display fixed
- vedi: bug that one could not open include files via double click. Stupid Windows file separator - to do a RegExp one must use "\\\\"!
- assi: fixed a bug, that could lead to an out of memory error while creating CNT files
- codi: fixed a bug, where linenumbering was not correct upon opening a file
- vecx: changed vector integrator max a bit. Protector does some "strange" death "reset" - there was a diagonal
        line displayed. This was due to the integrators being to exact in the former emulation
- vecx: bug, where efficiency could lead to negative vectorlengths -> black screen!

31st of March 2017
------------------
Version 1.13

new: 
- vedi: navigation panel added to vedi. This includes two different functions:
        a) a history of "editor-jumps" - you can no go back and forth in your jump history (arrow buttons)
        b) added a table that shows all available labels of the current source, double click jumps to the
           label. Also - it can be configured what types of labels are displayed
- ym: added afx files to the lister table (playable upon double click to channel A)
- vecx: added "intensity" drift
- vecx: added option to allow ROM-write access (to find bugs...)
- vecx: changed painting of "pause mode"
- dissi: added cli command "rd"
- dissi: added breakpoint type "PC" (dissi breaks on pc = weird address, 
         weird = higher rom size and smaller 0xe000 - yes, also pc = RAM)
- dissi: added breakpoint type "NZ" (dissi breaks on at the executed address integrators are non zero) - only meaningfull w/o drift
         (also as hey dissi variant: ; hey dissi "break integratorzero")
- dissi: changed assi warning of double defined variable to only warn if variable is defined differently 
         (structs with same names gave warnings all the time)
- dissi: user defined RAM labels have now precedence over BIOS (Tomlin style) labels
- dissi: added dissi comand line "quiet" - to not print breakpoints in all verbosity
- assi: added a "#pragma"tic approach - if you have a comment "; #noDoubleWarn" behind a label, 
        than a double definition of that label does not result in a warning (pun intended :-)) 
- assi+dissi: added two new CNT keywords:
        FORCE_SYMBOL #adresse# label
        FORCE_NO_SYMBOL #adresse#
        Assi (as usual) automatically creates these entries while assembling. 
        The "good" thing is, that the correct labels are used in dissi when a label is double defined.
        (in coding release I double/tripple used some RAM locations, and I was annoyed by always reading in 
         dissi exactly the wrong names).
        Before the first "fitting" label was used - now the exact label (if possible).
        Also if you use a number - dissi does not desperatly try to find a label, but uses a number where
        a number was written in the source.
- vedi+assi+dissi: watches can be added from vedi (right mouse click on label, select watches in popup)
- starter: added most of the university project files
- vedi: support to output 2 banks to VecFever (64k is built automatically after compile)

BugFix:
- vecci: bug introduced with grid optimiziation (if grid was not displayed, the cross was incorrect)
- dissi: watch add from source code with hey dissi - "type 5" was not correctly interpreted
- dissi: hey dissi breakpoints work now with banks too
- vedi: gui breakpoints were saved to one line further... - corrected
- vedi: syntax coloring again a little bit more stable...
- vedi: linenumbers were sometimes "erratic" I think I fixed that 
- vecxi: starting in debug mode now correctly works for banks
- dumpi: in dumpi vectorlists can now be shown that were generated to RAM
- vecci: updateting the 3d sliders did not update the preview anymore - lost it at some stage -> corrected

21st of February 2017
---------------------
Version 1.12

new: 
- vedi: double middle click on a BIOS function now does not jump to the include file, but rather to
        the BIOS disassembly itself, so one can examine the function more closely 
- vedi: added to popup menu option to insert generated data (sin, cos, circle)
- doc: corrections and additions
- vecci: grid display optimized, grid is only displayed, if at most width/2 lines would be displayed
         otherwise grid is not displayed at all (since you would not be able to discern a grid anyway)
- dissi: for convenience added a "reg" tab to dissi, this actually is the SAME as regi,
         due to "compatabilty" the old regi window is still available as before
- vecx: option for cartridges if a rom file is > 32k and NOT a bankswitch cart
        (e.g. programmer had forgotten an "org" with RAM)
- vecx: additional default search directory for overlays "overlay/homemade"
- util: added "truncate" to the file utils

BugFix:
- config: rotation-setting was not properly saved 
- corrected html file for BIOS, "<" and ">" were not saved html conform
- ym: uncompressed now also outputs reg 13 if it is $ff
- ym: streamed now also supports regs 11,12,13
- config: if config is called and no vecxi window open, there was a nullpointer exception
- vedi: linenumbers were not correct after inserting vectorlists
- vedi: selecting a filename in the tree did not always switch the tab if file was already open
- vecci: removed possible deadlock in "fitByte"
- vedi: trying to do better with variable scanning,
        still not performant enough - but might be more plausibly now, I should
        redesign the whole thing!
- vecx: corrected sometimes faulty overlay load from cartridge 

19th of January 2017
--------------------
Version 1.11

new: 
- vecci: added very basic support to export vector lists to SVG (lines only)
- vedi: variables scanned respect capital and non capital letters
- vedi: vectorpanel, has the option of "upscaling" an image (partial image)
- assi: added option to enable warning on multiple "defines" of same symbol (default is ON)
- vedi: added tooltip to "tab" that shows the full path of the edited file
- vedi: added dialog if "injection" is chosen, and the running file has a different name
- dissi: variable panel "table" is now sortable
- dissi: variable panel, 8bit and 16 bit columns can be edited (and are written to memory)
         therefor, double click on 16 bit column does not invoke dumpi, to invoke dumpy now
         shift+double click is needed
- vecxi: added configuration for "zeroing divider"
- vecxi: added some thoughts about "zero retain"
- vecxi: disabled emulation options I think are "wrongly" implemented (overflow)
- vedi: added scheduler, that updates var definitions every 30 seconds
- vedi: enabled saveAll button
- vedi+assi: added "visual breakpoints", click on line number in vedi toggles breakpoint for that line 
        (background of linenumber changes to red), technically a "hey dissi "break"" is added at compile time
- raster: fixed a bug with generating "shiftreg9 bug" compatible raster lists
- vedi: editor remembers the position of open and recent files
- vedi: added a table to display all bookmarks (double click jumps to bookmark)
- vedi: added a table to display all breakpoints (double click also jumps to breakpoints)
- vecxi: added options to rotate display in 90° steps
- vecxi: added in config a new combo box next to the "vectrex generation" to chose the "delay variant"

BugFix:
- dissi: possible crash when watches were "open" and vecxi was closed
- all: a couple of size corrections in various windows
- vedi: sizing of split panel in vedi "corrected"
- vedi: vectorPanel, image is now in a scrollpane and can not "outsize" the dialog anymore
- all: some spelling corrections
- dumpi: possible crash in dumpy removed, where addresses could be negative
- vedi: scan and jump to include files in subdirectories were not processed correctly

25th of December 2016
---------------------
Version 1.10

new: 
- vecxi: Added another emulation to DS2430A "DS2430_READ_REGISTER", Alex Herberts original ProtectorLE reads values from
         the chip, that were "write once" only written to it by him. With the above DS2430A instruction those values can be read.
         (Edit of those internal values is possible in the "carti" window of dissi)
- carti: added some more internal registers to DS2431 window
- dissi: added "do not force iconify on run" as option
- raster: added "invert" button
- raster: for trial added some support for vertical lines
- raster: added mirror settings
- raster: added "fixed" for sizes
- dissi: added 2 complement to cli calculator
- vedi: added 2 complement to cli calculator
- vecxi shortcuts added (1->save, 2->load, b->toggle ringbuffer)
- dissi: windows which are already opened, pop to front if corresponding button is pressed in dissi
- vedi: first VecFever support. Ejecting of USB devices for now only working under Win and Mac.
        I have no "native" linux system atm, and all experiments using emulators have not worked out well.
        Also I would love a way to eject the VecFever RAMDISK without a "sudo".  
        This is not a MAJOR hassel, Linux users must press one button more on the vectrex side - thats all!
 - config: LAF editor callable from config
 - dissi: added watches, watches can be defined in source "hey dissi "watch $someVariable 0|1|2|3|4|5,x""
          add via command line, add via popup
          remove via command line/popup
 - dumpi: memory locations can be directly edited in dumpi "table"
 - dissi hey dissi "print $var [8|16]" - accepts additional parameter to display 16 bit vars
 - vedi: immediate access to larger font selection
 - vedi: changed line numbering implementation 
 - vide: tried to "fix" vide to support larger font "lafs"
 - many: many windows support larger font sizes (and still look sort of ok'ish)
         To change windows to at least be workable with variable sized fonts was hard work, every
         window was edited multiple times to accomodate Mac and Windows (did not check Linux)
         While not all windows have been processed (some dissi panels were left out)
         Most seem to work, awaiting bug reports about which other windows should be done, or corrected)
- assi: output control files of assembled sources include "length" of data sections
- vec32: added maximum (200,000) of files in tree -> prevent Vec32 from stalling
- vedi: added example code generation in "Project" for eEprom2431
- codelib: added VecZ

BugFix:
- vecxi: Thomas discovered a bug in Vide, RTI instruction was falsely emulated, the CC register was 
         pulled after E-Flag check, should have been pulled before!
- vedi: TAB for indent was not working correctly -> fixed
- vedi: convenience added, CMD/F (or CTRL) now not only focuses the search textfield, but also selects the text
- vecxi: fixed bug where it was possible in vecxi that the integration variables (doubles) could 
         be NaN, once that was reached, no other value could be set, -> blank screen
- vecxi: shift register timing for modes with T2 timer were also only half the original -> corrected
- vedi: removed a bug where the syntax colorer, could be initiated twice - that was potentialy using to much CPU power
- vide: image cache is per default switched off, images might load slower, but the "standing" memory usage is reduced by
       about 200MB. Cache can be switched on in Application configuration though.
       This should get rid of most OOM situations, now even with starter open, the memory imprint is about 16MB.
- vecxi: keyboard "O" for overlay switch, now also loads overlays if they weren't previously loaded

27th of November 2016
---------------------
Version 1.09

new: 
- vecci: added menu entry "switch orientation" for a selected vector
- vecci: split where needed with need edit value
- vecci: remove point (join two neighbouring vectors)
- tracki: added delete button
- tracki: added view to current cycle count (number based)
- tracki: now ignores "0" minimum values, also skips unrealistic high values in min/max/avg
- ym: three convenient buttons, to swap voices from one channel to another
- ym: added option to multiply an amplitude of a channel
- regi: added output of current running cycle count
- dissi: added breakpoint ability in write access to ROM (only from CLI in dissi)
- dissi: added to 'hey dissi "break"' an optional additional parameter 'once' -> 'hey dissi "break once"'
- assi: option to output unused (but defined) symbols to CNT file
- vecxi: added emulation of DS2431

BugFix:
- vecci: saving of vectorlist did not correctly respect double/single usage of vertex
         using seperate vertex with the same position resulted in a single vertex after load -> fixed
         (Vertex have now an ID tag in the xml - due to processing loading of xml files without id tag
          takes a bit longer)
- dissi: enlarging from iconified state sometimes did not update the table (== crooked display)
         -> possibly fixed 
- vecci: another bug fixed with vectorlist loaded, where different single vertex with the same coordinates
         were falsely connected after a load from file
- vecxi: corrected false state loading, where Keyboard 0 could be unset

14th of November 2016
---------------------
Version 1.08

BugFix:
- vecci: Bug where joining of vectors could lose some vectors 

14th of November 2016
---------------------
Version 1.07

new: 
- vecxi: added timing parameters for T1 and SHIFT - I am getting more and more unhappy with the current delay 
         emulation features (see blog). With the current emulation NOT in all circumstances 
		 (the more timing critical the more inaccurate) the results are like the real machine!
- config: window is now scrollable
- vecxi: HotKey Buttons "P" Pause/Unpause and "O" Overlay on/off
- library: added/changed some documents

BugFix:
- vecci: removed <another> possible deadlock scenario in vecci with the animation preview (thread) - damn that is annoying 
- vecci: fixed another vectorlist clone bug (vecci), that prevented (upon other things) to do a correct preview in the monitor
- vecxi: "manual" setting of CB2 through the via control register is only possible if shift is not output to PB2, this
         was not correctly emulated before
- vecxi: changed drift emulation slightly
- vecxi: efficiency emulation is now switched on per default

18th of October 2016
--------------------
Version 1.06
new: 
- vedi: upon closing of an editor, the corresponding file in the tree gets unselected

BugFix:
- vecci: images converted to vectors, had a bad "border", when only a partial image was used
- vecci: HLR z = -z
- vecci: fixed bug, where "join here" resulted in a "lost" vertex
- ym: fix to playing AYFX with disabled noise (was choppy) 
- ym: streaming detecting of voice usage was flawed (always using 0 as target)

14th of October 2016
--------------------
Version 1.05
new:
- vecx: psg emulation, changed internal data generation to 16 bit + oversampling
- vecx: sound "lines" now inherent to psg section, not vecx, this makes it 
        easier to update the output to the lines directly when psg registers change,
        should be more acurate 
- ym: added "import" of ym data lines (from ascii file)
- dissi: added an ym 'line' to ayi
- vecx: added all neccessary code to implement the LED of "BinaryStars" Xmas Cart 2015
        to actually see the emulation, you need a ROM dump of the card, the "free" version does
        not contain the corresponding code sections.
- dissi: added to "hey dissi" #reg to print registers, e.g.: hey dissi "print #a #b", also $intx and $inty
- ym: added asm vectrex player for "streamed" data, also enhanced coder,
      streamed coder now analyses ym data and only encodes needed data, player is configured
      to only decode needed data with "if" statements.
      The player is without doubt the fastest, but also the one that does not - NOT pack very well...
- vecci: added a button for an extra editor window, that window displays the standard "editor" and is resizable, so
      larger editor areas are now available
- vecci: settings are now persistent (grid and scale)
- vecci: added a small scroll button section, you can now "move" in the editor window
      sideways (displacement width = gridwidth)
- all: allow open of multiple instances of vedi/codi/vecci (shift menu entry)
- vecci: included settings for output, db/fcb, hex/dec

BugFix:
- vedi: the list of last opened files could get scrambled - fixed

3rd of October 2016
-------------------
Version 1.04
new:
 - dissi: added 2 complement to register tooltip in reggi
 - dissi: added enhanced tooltip to CC in reggi
 - ym: added "player" mode
 - ym: shift double click on column textfield, sets the value to the complete (register) column
 - allow of envelopes in YM-file generation (in general)

bugfixes:
 - vedi: <again> seemingly fixed a bug, where the coloror was disabled
 - ym: possible Nullpointer Exception fixed
 - corrected ym-file generation output to respect reg13 as 0xff if no changes happened
 - corrected ym player in respect to that as well (both on the java side in YMSound and asm player in generation (only the new one))
 - corrected PSG emulation to correctly emulate envelope generation
   (although someday I have to enhance sample rates, as it is it emulation sounds quite terrible!)

1st of October 2016
-------------------
Version 1.03
new:
 - tracki: now also shows the average of the current timings
 - ym: added a new mode to export, this one is the new preffered export "module"
       also did bugfixing
       "preprocessing" of ym files as options, default is off, whether it is worth switching these
       on depends on the ym files themself

bugfixes:
- vecci: the last fixes disabled most of the source exports, this had to be fixed :-)

27th of Septmber 2016
---------------------
Version 1.02
new:
- vec32: added a "utility" window to support editing/saving/running of Vectres32 (BASIC) programs
         including editor (+ syntax highlighting) and a terminal
- vecci: added support to import Wavefront OBJ files
- vecci: support for hidden line removal and definition of faces
- vecci: points can be selected (deselected) by clicking on the corresponding columns in the vectorlist table
- vecci: export status reflects order of vectorlists
- vecci: added export for vectorlists to BASIC (Draw_VL_Mode only)
- vecxi: added emulation for the phenomenon, that integration is possible during "zero enable",
         also added emulation that zeroing is not spontanous but a going down to zero over time
- ym: added support to export data to BASIC (uncompressed only, and only "all" registers)
- doc: documentation for most of the mentioned changes/enhancements
- template: updated vectorlist templates to handle vectorlists > 8bit (length)
- template: templates for BASIC YM-Play and vectorlist display

bugfixes:
- vecci: deadlock in animation fixed
- vecci: shortcut buttons "order", "split", "connect" do not produce garbage when called with "deformed" vectorlists
         (deformed here: vertice that are "relative"- used by more than two vectors)
- dissi: CNT files a bit more robust in respect to "SPACES"
- vedi: possibly solved another deadlock with syntax highlighting
- vedi: bug where line numbering was not updated after "pasting" 
- sound: added log output to TinySound
- vecx: checks that TinySound is initialized (before null pointer exceptions were thrown)

7th of Septmber 2016
--------------------
Version 1.01
bugfixes:
- dissi: double click on address row for small 16bit addresses did not work as intended


6th of September 2016
---------------------
Vide version 1.0 release
